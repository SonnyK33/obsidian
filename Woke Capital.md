Development as conceived by developed countries has largely been another arm of imperialism. It encourages the dismantling of state institutions and relies on private sector investment for developing key infrastructure. Itâ€™s the successor to policies enacted by European colonizers in Africa and Asia. They developed railroads to extract resources. USAID and OPIC were the American versions of colonial financial institutions. The supranational organizations get preferential treatment and encourage austerity.

This complements the other article that talked about the golden age of development prior to 1970 and during the days of Bretton Woods. He quotes from a book that discusses the African self determination movement.
