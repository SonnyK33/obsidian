After China failed to gain its territories back back after WW1, its leader (who only took power in 1911 after the Manchus abidated) resigned and the country fell to warlords. Sun Yat Sun attempted to get Western support for a new government but failed. Some in the Kuomintang looked to the Soviet Union where the Russian revolution recently took place. The soviets had given back many of the concessions which were taken by the Tsars, and some were looking for a second country to stage a communist revolution. 

CKS rose through the ranks of the Kuomintang and was a disciple of [[Sun Yat Sen]]. After he defeated the communist wing of the Kuomintang in the Shanghai incident, the West saw him as part of the resistance to communism and as pillar in Asia after Japan's defeat. Many in the US also thought they owed something to China after the concessions made to Japan after WW1, including granting them Germany's concessions. This betrayal is also one of the reasons why the senate rejected joining the League of Nations after the Treaty of Versailles. He derived much of his power in the US from the backing of the missionaries (with whom he scored points by marring into the Soong family). 

CKS, through his marriage, became connected to powerful Soong family. This included his brothers-in-law TV Soong and HH Kung. The family benefited from corruption and high taxes and were known to skim off the top of military purchases. They made money from silver speculation directly tied to government policies. The Soong family also had powerful connections with the missionaries, especailly Henry Luce who led Life Magazine. The missionaries minimized differences between KG and the communists and painted CKS as a vanguard for democracy. Reporters in China had to be accredited by the CKS government and were censored. They were prevented from describing the government truthfully. When the CKS government requested aid or arms from the US, its friends and lobbyists argued that aid was necessary to prevent it from moving closer to Japan. CKS' policies led to hyperinflation which destroyed the middle class-- many of whom would've preferred it to the communists. When Madame Soong travelled to the US, Roosevelt saw her as less of a democratic figure and more like a Queen. Nevertheless, he saw no alternative than to continue supporting CKS. 

Japan was growing increasingly militaristic after WW1 and especially after a series of naval treaties in the 20s which capped Japan's capabilities. The far right in Japan subsequently forced the government to abandon these treaties.  Japan sought to dominate Asia and started by biting off pieces of China-- beginning with Manchuria where they fabricated an incident (Marco Polo bridge) to create a puppet regime.  CKS wasn't willing to fight Japan's modern military and instead focused on the communists. As Japan expanded, the US faced a dillemma. It felt a commitment to China, but it didn't want to antagonize Japan which was a larger trading partner than China or risk the security of Philippines. China was more important to the UK, but even it wondered if it was important enough to anger Japan. Russia was more weary of Japan and wanted to push them to fight China and helped stir up Chinese nationalism against Japan. Japanese moderates convinced the West to not push them to war and painted themselves as leaders of an anti-communist alliance. The US in turn initially directed CKS to not antagonize Japan. Even after Germany began the war in Europe, many in the West didn't see the importance of the Asian theatre. The US continued to trade scrap metal with Japan. Policymakers were reluctant to impose an arms embargo against Japan as they feared it would push them closer to Germany and Italy. Japan's thirst for natural resources eventually led it to invade the Dutch East Indies and Malay. The West began to realize that the Philippines, HK, India, and even Hawaii could be next. The US only put an arms embargo against Japan, after it gained a presence in Indochina by taking over France's possessions in Hanoi (after the latter's defeat by Germany). It imposed an oil embarge after it learned of Japan's intention to take Siam next. Soon thereafter, Japan attacked Pearl Harbour and subsequently took over Philippines, the Dutch Indies, Siam, and Guam. Hong Kong surrendered to Japan. It soon took Malay and Burma through Singapore. 

Japan initially saw CKS as a possible ally as they were afraid of Russian forces infiltrating the Kuomintang and saw CKS as an anti-communist. CKS himself was trained in Japan and had ties to various criminal organizations (secret socities). After invading Manchuria, Japan exerted a lot of influence in Northern China, and . CKS was seen as someone who could bring order after the chaos of the warlord era. While Mao was organizing rent strikes, many in the capitalist class didn't want to lose their connections. CKS purged the communists from the Kuomintang (an event known as the Shanghai Incident and chronicled in [[A man's fate - WIP]]) with the help of the French secret service. Due to these compromises with the West, the KG became a white terror campaign and lost many supporters. The KG heavily taxed the population, and the vast majority of funds went to the military and to corruption.

US-UK support for China was hampered by distrust between the UK and China. The UK didn't think China was up to the task of defending itself, and China harbored resenment over the unequal treaties. They both cared about reopening Burma though-- the UK needed to secure India and China needed it to access lend lease resources. Roosevelt didn't care about protecting British possessions which Churchill obviously valued. Roosevelt even once suggested granting independence to India which was angrily rejected. Roosevelt wanted China to takeover the guardianship of Asia from Japan and the Delano family maintained ties to China. Churchill wanted to regain all possessions in Asia, especially Hong Kong, but also Singapore and Malay. The UK relied on Indian troops to fight in Burma, but they were also afraid that some may defect to the Japanese side. The troops were trained for desert warfare (to protect UK possessions in the Middle East) and not to protect their own land. Infrastructure between Burma and India was non-existent; this bolstered the British shipping companies which help monopoly-like possessions and made it harder for anyone to reach India. The UK wasn't willing to make any concessions to the Burmese or Indians, as they assumed they'd regain their colonial posessions at the peace table. 

When the Allies met ahead of the pacific campaign, and Roosevelt and CKS met for the first time, it was agreed that Taiwan and Manchuria would be returned to China, along with bonus Japanese Islands (bonen islands). This was known as the Cairo declaration. During the planning of the campaign however, American generals revolted and disagreed with diverting resources from Europe. When CKS learned of this, he blamed Stillwell. He argued that it was Stillwell's incompetence and lack of connections with Washington that kept the lend lease program from reaching CKS's desired level.  The US government began to distrust CKS and started pushing him to work with the communists to fight against Japan. These faced internal opposition in the US as well. The communists successfully infiltrated Japanese lines by offering tax relief and working with landlords willing to cooperate. They gained the trust of the pesants by providing something in return for tax dollars. CKS reluctantly allowed them into his army, but only if they pledged loyalty to the Central government (which he knew many wouldn't). After Stillwell was recalled, many in the state department pushed for more cooperation with the Communists. However the official policy remained that the US couldn't work with a dissident group. Many in the US were also weary of the Communists just as the Cold War was beginning. Roosevelt's mistake was not realizing that the Communists weren't just an opposition party but a force much more potent and coherent than the KG. They had more support and were much more competent. 

Most people in the US did not consider Chinese communists to be real communists and never believed they would defeat KG and eventually take over China. They saw them as remedying structural inequalities, especially land distribution. They reasoned that they couldn't be real communists since communists were by definition "bad", and these groups were actually good. When reporters were allowed into Communist-controlled areas they wrote that the people appeared less malnourished and more motivated. Officials were less corrupt and the land was less barren 

Stillwell, along with much of the US establishment, saw communists in China as a local phenomenon and not as a foreign plot. They saw how KG's corruption and inequality (especially regarding land ownership) empowered the communists. The final split between Stillwell and CKS was driven by the former's desire to work with the Communists. 

CKS pushed the US for help building its air force, and got support from many in the US, most notably Chennault. They downplayed Stillwell's ground ambitions and focused on building air support to attack Japan. Stillwell argued that air bases would still have to be defended by ground forces and was eventually proven right. They also started the lend lease program under which China would borrow to purchase American equipment. Many in the US and China got rich from these transactions. 


Stillwell's Burma campaign failed, and all forces retreated to India. Stillwell refused air support and led his men on foot. On return, he blamed failure largely on the British who he accused of wanting to lose to weaken China. As the rift between Stillwell and CKS grew, Stillwell was eventually recalled. While Roosevelt didn't trust CKS he knew that any American general there needed the respect of CKS or else he'd have to back a new leader for China, and he wasn't prepared to do that. Stillwell was recalled just as communist hysteria was growing.  After Stillwell was recalled, any illusions of China's role in the war faded away. Roosevelt instead made concessions to Stalin (including those promised to China). He needed the Soviets help to defeat the Japanese in Manchuria. Once the Americans captured Manchuria there was no longer any need for a landing on the Chinese coast, as they assumed Japan would withdraw forces to hold the main islands. After Japan refused to surrender, the two nuclear bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. 

After Japan surrendered, the task turned to getting the Japanese in China to surrender (there were 1m Japanese in Manchuria, and almost as many in the rest of the country). They had to reoccupy many cities including Manchuria which Japan held for 15 years and Taiwan which Japan held for 50. CKS wasn't prepared for such a complex undertaking and there was a race to reach the cities before the Communists did. The US started poring in aid including transport to support KG. As aid only went to one side, clashes with the Communists were inevitable. It was the start of the US taking sides in the Chinese civil war. Communists protested as American equipment was used to transport nationalist forces. Ambassador Hurley accused the State Department of harboring pro-communist leanings and the age of [[Mccarthyism]] began. General Marshall who was in charge of unifying China concuded that they had to support the Nationalists or risk losing the purpose of being in China in the first place. George Marshall decided to send nationalist forces to the North if the Communists wouldn't compromise but to still support CKS if he didn't -- that is to support CKS regardless. Stillwell privately remarked that he was tempted to lead the communists himself. This was leaked as part of a smear campaign against him. 

Marshall demanded that CKS cooperate with the communists or else aid would be shut down. CKS and the hardliners  considered discussions unthinkable and refused. They instead continued to lobby for more aid to defeat the communists. Marshall told them they couldn't win militarily, and told Truman they couldn't win without direct American involvement. There was no support for this, so instead, the China lobby got arms and financial support. Even Marshall recognized that while the Communists had fewer people, they were more organized and more competent.
