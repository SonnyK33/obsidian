Bacon believed science was a way to advance human prosperity and whose goals were different than religion. He was religious himself. The church started becoming hostile to science as different explanations were offered. He didn’t think knowledge seekers were going about it the right way or for the right reasons including the rationalists. Rationalists pursue knowledge with reason and without requiring experimentation. As Plato believed, people were born with total knowledge. He saw superstitious people as the other extreme who made up rules regarding the physical world without reason. Bacon thought the ideal was in between. The point of science was to harness nature for our benefit. He references the compass, printing press, and gun powder. The government should finance science for the benefit of humanity.

He believed we are  guilty of 4 biases:

The tribe - trusting your sense too much 
Idles of the cave - biased by our customs and how we’ve been raised
Idles of the marketplace - based on what we envision when we communicate with each other. Words carry different connotations. And they can be manipulated. E.g. socialized medicine
Idles of the theatre - Accepting philosophical systems that have been taken for granted. E.g. accepting segregation because it's always been like that
