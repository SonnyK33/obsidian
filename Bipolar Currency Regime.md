[[Dollar Hegemony]]
[[China vs US - Dollar Dominance]]
Author: Roubini

A bipolar currency regime will replace the dollar’s exorbitant privilege  
  
Geopolitical rivalry bw China and the US will move the world closer to a bipolar reserve system. Chinas capital controls were often cited for why the RMB couldn’t be a reserve currency. But the US has its own capital controls - sanctions against rivals and even secondary sanctions. They also block investment into certain sectors. Many EMs will now want to hold some reserves in RMB.

China will have to start running deficits to generate enough liabilities. It’s likely that they’re moving away from their trade surplus model anyways. There’s also the triffen dilemma that says a country’s deficits (which are needed to be the reserve currency) eventually undermine that country’s role as the reserve currency issuer. China is actively trying to replace the dollar with swap lines and bilateral local currency lines. The digital currencies will also make it easier to switch from the dollar.
