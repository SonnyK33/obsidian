Makes the argument that government deficits are a consequence of excess savings in the private sector. This ignores the impact of the external imbalance (current account deficit). The author attributes it to less risk-taking post-GFC and a reluctance to take on debt. His arguments only really make sense if there is an external balance, which is how he starts the piece.
