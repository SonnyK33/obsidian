The IS/LM model was used in Keynesian models to describe how interest rates and national income affect the market for credit (LM) and economic goods (IS). The intersection of the curves represents the equilibrium between interest rates and output/income. The model is meant to show how the markets for good and credit interact to produce the prevailing rate of interest and GDP (income)

On a typical graph, the horizontal axis is income/output, and the vertical is interest rates. The IS curve is downward sloping, as lower rates of interest will lead to higher output. At lower rates, firms and households can borrow and invest. This should lead to higher output. The IS curve represents all levels of interest rates and GDP at which investment equals savings. The LM curve represents all levels of interest rates and GDP at which the money supply equals money demand. At higher levels of income, there would be more demand to borrow and higher interest rates. Hence, the LM curve is upward sloping. 

The IS/LM model is rarely used today as it can't account for high unemployment simultaneously with high inflation. It's utility also decreased when central banks started targetting interest rates and not money supply.
