Delta hedging a positively convex position has dampening effect on the market. So the "santa rally" will likely be muted this year.

**From Delta Hedging**
If you’re hedging a short gamma position (eg short puts which dealers tend to be), you’ll do it in a way that exacerbates the underlying move. That’s because when the underlying moves, your losses are non-linear. 

When you’re hedging positive gamma position (long calls which dealers also tend to be) you’ll do it in a way that dampens the move - since you’re gaining non-linearly from the move. 

Can look at skew to get an idea of dealers most likely long gamma (likely w/ calls) or short (w/ puts). Can expect more vol close to expiry if dealers are short gamma.

Dealers tend to be long gamma but can change to short gamma is there’s a big downturn.

Skew is at historically low levels as there is limited demand for downside protection. As the Fed's hawkish policy was telegraphed, the market was expecting a down turn going into 2022. That's now been replaced with an expectation that the Fed will quickly pivot and demand for upside risk. The muted demand for puts means dealers aren't as short puts as they are normally. 
Investors are usually long puts and short calls, making dealers short puts (negative convexity) and long calls (positive convexity). Going into year-end, dealers are likely less short puts and less long calls. I'm not sure how this balances out, but given market action in Q4, I'm assuming the "less short puts" side is winning out meaning dealers are more positively convex. Delta hedging a positively convex position has dampening effect on the market. So the "santa rally" will likely be muted this year. 
The flattened skew will lead to lower vanna and charm flows
