Khalidi is the author of the 100 year war on Palestine. 

The land was promised to numerous people, including the Arabs and Jews. It's sometimes known as the “Thrice promised land”. Herzol's plan was to displace the indigenous population. He said it would move people across the frontiers. The population living there at the time was 95% Arab. He wanted to control the land and immigration to make it a Jewish state and claimed it would be good for the Arab population. The Balfour declaration only recognized the rights of Jews and it took 3 yrs and 100k troops to dispossess Arabs. The British did this to control Palestine.

The Book of Joshua, recognizes that Jews displaced other people. The Zionist claim is a settler claim and recognizes other people live there. The old testament said that it's not our ancient homeland but land to conquer. Religious Jews were hostile to Zionism initially as they believed they would only get the land at end of days. 

Ignoring the League of Nations, the British denied Palestinians self determination. Forty percent of Palestinians were forced from their home before 1948. The Jordanian king wasn’t concerned for Palestinians.

**1967 war**

Israel was going to preemptively attack, and they had permission from the US. The UN resolution at this time set aside refugee rights that were enshrined in 1948 resolution.  

**Oslo accords** 

There was a cap to what US and Israel would agree to. It would lead to the 1978 resolution with Carter and Begen. Rabin was first to agree to even negotiate with the PLO.
  
**Camp David**

Clinton was a lame duck by now and Arafat lost legitimacy as people were not happy with Oslo.

The solution from here is unclear, but we need to start with recognizing both parties as equal.
