- re-read Vogel's piece on Deng
- historical materialism and dialectical materialism.

This piece joins the many others warning the West about China's aggressiveness. Rudd's thesis is that President Xi's strict ideology will lead to conflict with the West. He contrasts Xi's actions with Deng's reopening. But he ignores the obvious differences in initial conditions. Deng inherited a closed off country. It was still suffering from the Cultural Revolution. Xi inherits the biggest (or second biggest) economy in the world. The West paints adversaries as personifications of their ruler (Saddam, Putin, Chavez, etc). This masks the legitimate grievances of the citizens of those countries. It keeps up the illusion that the US cares about democratic values and human rights. A large part of China's increasing assertiveness is due to it being much stronger than it was in the past. It not longer has to play by the US' rules. Some of Rudd attempts to tie policies to ideology are strange. He argues that Xi may interpret the US' alliances in the Pacific as hostile due to his Marxist philosophy. China views those alliances as hostile because they're meant to counter China.

Some of China's conflicts with its neighbours are also legacies of colonialism. The Taiwanese and Indian conflicts should be viewed from that perspective.


Xi is much more focused on Marxist -Leninist ideology than his predecessors, and is a throwback to Mao in terms of ideology. He’s more pragmatic but sees China through the lens of class struggle with right wing forces - the private sector, NGOs, religious organizations, 
and of course the US. He’s also sure China is on the right side of history.

Unlike Deng, Xi is insisting on remembering Chinas history especially the century of humiliation. He understands and appreciates the power of nationalism much more than Deng. When Deng was opening up the economy,  he accepted some inequality and said that it may persist for centuries. Xi has  abandoned this and wants to get to a more equal society quicker. Xi is counting on a rising nationalist generation - those people who studied in China, unlike their predecessors who lived under more liberal governments and studied in the west. This also fits with a more aggressive foreign policy towards Taiwan, Japan, and India. 

Xi’s use of dialectical analysis may lead him to conclude that conflict is inevitable. Mao was similary ideological and hence  rapprochement with the US was delayed. China is likely to interpret US alliances w Japan, Australia, and India as hostile. **I found this point odd - these alliances are outwardsly hostile.**  

Xi's embrace of Marxism and focus on a more equitable world has also led its development model in the global south especially Africa. This reminded me of Cuba’s legacy in Africa. **These sound like good things to me.**

He may not want to give up power because he fears retribution from successor. **Rudd gives no evidence for what this retribution could be.** 

He’s more focused on politics than economics but lost faith in the free market after the GFC and China’s own market collapse in 2015. This also highlights his biggest vulnerability - the economy. If the embrace of Marxism turns off investment, economic growth could decrease. With an ageing population, will have to decide between pensions and welfare system and military spending.
