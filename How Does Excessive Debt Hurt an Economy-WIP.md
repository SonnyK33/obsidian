There are always constraints on how much a monetary sovereign can borrow, even though there aren't direct spending constraints. A country can't consume and invest more than it produces or imports. Increased government spending leads to more demand in one sector of the economy. If the spending leads to an equivalent increase in supply (through investment or consumption that leads others to invest), there are no constraints. But when it leads to more demand than supply, it represses demand in one sector of the economy to make up the imbalance.

This imbalance can be resolved in 4 different ways:

1) Transfers
If rising debt causes demand to rise without commensurate rise in debt-servicing capacity (normally measured by GDP), this requires a shift to bring back a balance. The demand typically gets allocated to non-productive/inefficient uses. This includes excessive defense spending, wasted infrastructure, or speculation. Excessive debt or inflation may deter businesses from investing or lead people to expect higher taxes. If they cause trade deficits, unemployment and household debt can rise.

2) Financial distress
High levels of debt cause economic agents to change their behavior. Businesses defer investing, consumers withhold expenditures. The analog is a corporate who's in distress. Owners won't invest further in the business as the gains will accrue to the creditors (see: [[Volatility Machine]])
