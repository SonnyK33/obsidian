**How is money created**
1) In the modern economy money is primarily created by commercial banks who create money by lending it out. When a bank issues a loan, it simultaneously creates a bank deposit for the borrower; this bank deposit is new money in the economy. When the loan is paid off, the reverse happens - the deposit and loan are both eliminated. Many think that it's the other way around - loans are issued from deposits held.

2) Money is also created by central banks when they execute open market transactions or QE. When they purchase treasuries from banks, they are replaced by reserves on the latter's balance sheet. If they're purchased from non-banks, reserves are created on the entity's bank's balance sheet.

3) Directly lending from the Fed(primary - lending 1-28 days and secondary - for troubled banks thru discount window (think this creates reserves - check)
	- though there is a stigma attached to this
	
4) Repos - collateraized loans made to primary dealers - collateral something like treasuries. Since treasuries can be converted to deposits freely (and converted back), they are also money-like. 


Loan issuance is driven by the existence of profitable lending opportunities which can be modelled by NIMs - net interest margins. The cost of funding will be in part driven by the cost of reserves which is controlled by the Fed.




**Central Bank Reserves**
Reserves are analagous to commercial bank deposits held at the Fed. That is, they are assets for commercial banks and liabilities for central banks. They are freely convertible to currency (coins and banknotes), and may need to be converted if there are customer withdrawals. They are used to settle inter-bank payments. 
e.g.
You make a deposit in bankA
bank A BS:
DR cash asset
CR deposit liability

you send the money in exchange for goods to another customer who uses bank B
bank A BS:
DR deposit liability
CR reserves asset

bank B BS:
DR reserves asset
CR deposit liability

e.g.
When someone takes a mortgage to buy a house, a deposit is created along with a loan (CR loan, DR deposit). When the house is purchased, the deposit transfers to the seller’s bank (CR bank reserves, DR deposit) - an added step could be made where the borrower withdraws in cash and then sends the cash to the seller - using reserves avoids this. Rather than cash transferring from one bank to the other to settle, reserves are transferred. At the same time, the bank will seek to get more deposits, as there’s now a mismatch between loans (the mortgage loan is still on the Bank’s books) and funding (as reserves were transferred). So while deposits aren’t directly lent to borrowers, they do facilitate further lending by giving a bigger reserve cushion.

The amount of reserves held by a bank is a function of economic activity. The more inter-bank transfers and withdrawal requests, the more reserves they need to hold


Banks cannot lend (and create money without limit). There are three main constraints.

1) market forces 

Banks wish to earn a competitive spread interest on loans and costs of funding. When a loan is made, they may wish to get new deposits as well (since the deposit created from the loan will likely be withdrawn) and so may have to raise deposit rates to entice new depositors. Alternatively they may wish to lower lending rates to attract new loans. If the bank has to keep lowering lending rates and raising deposit rates, it may find it unprofitable to keep expanding. It also may need to offer higher deposit rates to attract stickier deposits - savings rather than checking accounts. So competition for loans and deposits constrains money creation. Credit risk around new loans also limits money creation. As the market heats up, businesses take up riskier projects which banks may not wish to fund. Finally, regulatory requirements around capital and liquidity limit money creation. 

2) uses of deposits

When a loan is taken and the deposit is spent, how the receiver uses the funds - whether to pay off debts (destroys money) or spends on new goods (continues money expansion) affects money creation. If the money is continuously spent without paying off existing debts (or spent on higher yielding assets) it can be inflationary (the hot potato effect).

3) Monetary policy

The central bank pays interest on reserves. This rate influences the rate banks lend in money markets and other loans. The rate on reserves plays a much bigger role in money creation than any requirements in quantity of reserves. 

This is the reverse of what many textbooks describe. Lower rates on reserves will lower lending rates (as can earn the same NIM and take more market share) and increase the stock of loans (and hence money supply). More money and spending will lead to customers and banks demanding more and fiat and reserves.
Summary of causation chain:

The cost of reserves (set by C bank) + availability of profitable projects = banks willingness to extend loans (becausec higher likelihood to make profitable loans).

This willingness to create credit causes the demand for base money (reserves + currency)

i.e. more lending tends to increase demand for reserves (bc more interbank transfers) and currency (bc more bank withdrawals)

So the quantity of reserves is a function of banks' willingness to lend (not the opposite, which is the way monetary policy worked pre-GFC)  

Below the zero-bound for rates, rate cuts start to lose power, and hence central bank shifted to alternative means of stimulus like QE. Negative rates mean banks should shift from reserves to currency (which pay zero but more than negative). Future changes to the cost of reserves would then have no impact on lending (since banks wouldn't hold any reserves).
  

**QE**

Money is created whenever banks make new loans. Broad money (deposits + currency) can also be created by central banks purchasing treasuries directly from non-banks. The entity will sell treasuries and receive bank deposits. The entity' bank will be credited with new reserves (since the entity doesn't have an account at the Fed) and will also have a new liability (the entity's deposit). The non-bank may then have more cash than it wishes and choose to invest or spend it (the point of QE)
