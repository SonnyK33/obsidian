As described in Second Leg Down, central banks create money by:

- Directly lending (primary - lending 1-28 days and secondary - for troubled banks thru discount window (think this creates reserves - check)
	- though there is a stigma attached to this

- Open market purchase of treasuries 

- Repos - collateraized loans made to primary dealers - collateral something like treasuries
