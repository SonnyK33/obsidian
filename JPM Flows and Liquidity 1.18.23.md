The impact of QT on banking system liquidity is a function of how much comes from RRP outflows versus banking reserves. Currently, RRP balances are sticky, and most of the flows are coming from banking reserves. Shortfalls in reserves could be an issue at the $2tr mark. 
One way which the Fed could push MMF's out of RRP and into t-bills is to change the counterparty rules on the facility. This would also cause t-bill yields to fall as well as deposit rates (though the latter has barely risen anyways.)
