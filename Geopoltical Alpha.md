**My Edge:**
The skills mismatch should be a great opportunity. Most know how to analyze financials but can’t read a balance of payments statement. Most don’t know how global monetary systems and trade work. This is a key opportunity for me especially coupled with deep secular research and credit knowledge. Trading + fundamentals + macro/politics/history/EM should be your edge. Need to articulate it better. **Think about convexity in geopolitical and macro terms.**


**Molecules:**
Develop idea - neoliberal order -Washington consensus as global vol suppressants - begets more vol

**To Check:**
In the 1960s inflation didn’t spike even after low unemployment. This caused complacency and allowed the government to expand fiscally -  Vietnam war, great society entitlements for example. (Cross-check here with monetary policy history book). Led to 1970 stagflation

Financial constraints - may differ from underlying economy. These are the best opportunities 
What does this refer to?

**Todos:**
Italy’s budget seems to be the most important analogue today
Use leader's power checklist for new Nigerian President
Econ constraints/101 - 
Check balance of payments, domestic budgets, unemployment, etc
Productivity, savings rate, insolvency laws etc

Net assessments - 
1) Discrete - specific events eg US' assassination of Iranian general. You'll need to react in the moment. Should make a list of possible events and conduct a net assessment of each so you can react accordingly 
  
2) Cyclical - medium term. Make net assessments for all relevant DM and EMs. Make a calendar of geopolitical events.

3) Thematic - long term e.g. collapse of USD as reserve currency. Think about what’s being taken for granted today eg a U.S. China conflict, End of USD hegemony etc. Conduct net assessments for any that you’re not 100pct sure of. The assessments will determine what are the relevant items to monitor. You need to identity the binding constraints (fulcrums) and monitor them closely Should be updating prior probabilities as more info comes in.


**Connections:**
On China property, remember that high apartment prices were one of the sources of the HK protests. It's unlikely that Xi allows China properties to become avenues for speculation. Affordability is key. China cares much more about public preferences than the West would have you believe. They made the decision to be competent rather than revolutionary and focus on public preferences after the collapse of the Soviet Union.

**Takeaway**
This book's central premise is that geopolitical assessments should be made based on constraints rather than the preferences of leaders. We often get excited by narratives, and may give a "market-friendly" leader too much credit, forgetting that real constraints will prevent any of his reforms from going through. Similarly, we may get bogged down in stereotypes and forget that even a "radical" leader is guided by constraints. The author divides these constraints into political, economic, geopolitical, and to a lesser extent, legal and time. Once you determine the binding constraints on a leader, you know what to monitor. As those items change over time, you can refresh your assessments. Determining constraints requires a deep understanding of history, context, and macroeconomics. Once you've determined the constraints, you need to form hypotheses for how those items could change over time. You  then look for dispositive information which will help you distinguish between the hypotheses and hence make predictions. As that information changes, your predictions change. 

For example, in Nigeria, a binding constraint is the country's refining capacity. I need to form hypothese over whether the Dangote refinery will get completed this year. I can then focus my research by looking for information that will specifically help me eliminate competing hypotheses - 1) will get completed in 2023 2) won't be completed till 2024 etc. As that info changes, my overall assessment for fiscal reforms (specifically eliminating the fuel subsidy) can change. 




**Intro**


Geopolitics for developed markets matters again. The financial crisis and ensuing Euro Area crisis in 2010 was the start. From the end of the cold war until that point, many argued that the whole world was moving towards liberal democracy and globalization. This is now reversing. The destruction of the middle class and the victory of capital over labour is experiencing a backlash. We're now moving towards a new cold war between the US and China. We're seeing the end of the Washington consensus and the re-emergence of polticized monetary policy, strong unions, and high inflation.

Stability begets volatility (like Minskys argument on markets), and the stability brought by the US allowed other countries to build up their own economies until they were dominant enough to challenge the US globally or regionally. China's an obvious example. But India, Brazil, Russia, and Saudi Arabia are others. 

Globalization moves in cycles. It can only last if a dominant power is willing to pick up the tab for global defense, patrolling trade routes etc. The US filled that role by running huge deficits which they could do because of the dollar’s hegemonic status. Neoliberal policies in the US and UK have come under attack domestically due to rising inequality making the US less likely to maintain this role. The developed countries' middle classes bore most of the cost for the US' dominance. The world is now becoming more multipolar, and that will lead to more volatility.

**Framework**
These are the premises underpinning the constraint system.

First pillar - Materialistic Dialectic
He uses Marx’s framework of focusing on the material world and people’s interests. This is different from the Hegelian dialectic which says that the world starts from ideas. Marx argued it starts from material interests and ideas are formed afterwards, to justify the realities.

Second pillar - Seek information that has high diagnostic value.
This is information that helps you eliminate alternative hypotheses. Information will always be limited and the quality matters more. Too much info can lead to overconfidence (as can specializing). Information that could lead to many outcomes isn’t useful. Evidence should help you narrow down potential outcomes. Once the key problems are identified, you need to come up with competing hypotheses. The next step is find information that helps you distinguish between the hypotheses.
  
Third pillar - Avoid attribution errors. 
Analysis (especially in the media) tends to attribute actions to the individual and personalities rather than context and history. People want to believe that humans drive events and not complex factors out of their control (or perhaps caused by the supposed good guys). The media people  what they want to hear. However, context and constraints tend to guide behavior not personalities. A good current example is tying all of Xi’s actions to his personality rather than China’s current status as a rival power to the US. I’d add that context tends to point the finger back at the powerful (often the US) and we don’t want to take responsibility for anything, and so we instead blame it on the foreign dictator. This pillar  drives home the goal of being dispassionate and focused on facts. It also means that one needs to understand the history of a region as much as possible. Reading about the Chinese civil war and subsequent turmoil is much more valuable than the latest psychological profile of Xi.

Making lots of predictions and then understanding why they did or didn’t work would be a good tool to understand how these pillars apply to a given situation. One can also try to do it retrospectively. Ex ante, would Putin invade Ukraine?

I said no. I thought the risk of backlash was too great and that there was no value to an occupation. Where did I go wrong?

Pillar 1 - I thought it was against Putin's interest to invade. What I didn't anticipate was that the Ukraine issue was seen as existential to Putin. It was worth risking economic isolation.

Pillar 2 - Information I should've sought:
- What were the consequences of Ukraine being a de facto NATO member?
- Would Russia survive isolation?
- What were the economic consequenes of cutting off trade with Russia? Specifically losing the ability to import
	- What did Russia import?

Pillar 3 - I think I got this part right. I didnt' focus on Putin or his desire to return to the Soviet Union's glory days.

**Constraint Model**
The author differentiates between constraints and preferences. The constraint model is equivalent to one based on preferences if constraints don’t exist. This is obvious; if constraints don't exist, leaders will do what they want to do. It still is necessary to learn what the preferences are of leaders. 

**Political Constraints**
Beware of experts who aren’t actually experts who funnel the views of a small group of people. 

He gives the example of Johnson’s actions during negotiations over Brexit. He was acting as if he was okay with a no deal brexit, and many connected sources echoed this. His preferences (as indicated by him) werr to act hawkish. But there were material constraints. Most importantly, a no deal brexit wasn’t popular with anyone. The key insight was that his revealed preference to act aggressively was “nondiagnostic”.  It made sense regardless of whether he actually wanted a no deal exit or not. He had to act tough to get the support from UK independence parties who were taking votes away from Tories.  

This seems obvious to me. The value is to separate a prediction into components.
1) he wants to act aggressively (preference) 
2) this will lead to a no deal Brexit 
3) no constraints 

There are obviously constraints, but his aggressive attitude led people to believe that they didn’t matter or he didn’t care. What you had to recognize is there were multiple reasons for him to act like this (That is, his behavior was non-diagnostic). Leaders always have satisfy domestic constituencies as well (Putnam's two level theory) and hawkish rhetoric is almost always non-diagnostic.   

If constraints are being overlooked, it's worth examining the leaders preferences and the context further. Funneling is what led to wrong forecasts around the Argentine election. Everyone talked to same small group of people in BA who told people what they wanted to hear. I’ve often noted this bias in EM. Rich expats tell rich Americans what they want to hear - that a poor country wants pro-market reforms. The author claims a HF called him a socialist for doubting Macri’s chances.   

Trusting insiders led people to doubt trump would pass tax reform. Side note - this was the first time since Kennedy/Johnson that an administration passed tax reform during an expansion (as detailed by Binder's Monetary History book). That led to inflation which was exacerbated by higher military spending (over Vietnam) which we're  seeing again. People are easily impressed by access - “So and so is close to the kremlin”. In Argentine case, people ignored how policies were unpopular and looked past the lack of recent polls. There was too much value  put polls run by campaigns.   

In the Trump tax case, people believed Republicans would still care about deficits with Trump in charge. Although it seems obvious to me that Republicans were hypocrites in this area, the S&P did pop 7% post reform, so it wasn’t priced in. Even tea party republicans said it didn’t have to be revenue neutral. 

Rather than relying on experts with supposed access, you should use certain kinds of political consultants - academics, regulators, and technocrats. It's important to identify the proper questions first (second pillar).

When analyzing a leader’s power, you must consider various factors.
1) How popular is he
2) how long has he been in power (most start with a honeymoon period)
3) how much control over legislature does he have
4) what's the economic context (did he create or inherit a crisis? Macri vs Bolsonaro for example)
5) how much support does he have from special interest groups
6) global context (e.g. Arab Spring, pink tide in Latin America)

Johnson faced several constraints preventing a no deal Brexit. The public didn’t support it, he wasn’t perceived as new as he took over May's government, and he lacked control over parliament.

Successful governments follow the mean value theorem [[Median Voter Theory]]. They figure out the most important issue, determine what the median voter wants, and then emulates that. Trump and Brexiteers realized globalization and immigration were the most important and they had support from the median voter. While it's important to guage what the public wants, you shouldn't discount the governments ability to change minds. The incumbent especially can influence the media to change what the public thinks is the most important (e.g getting the public to support the US' current wars, despite it not being the main issue for most Americans). Policymakers can deviate from median voter preferences temporarily, but eventually they’re forced to return. For example, Trump passed corporate tax cuts, going against his populist message, but he lost in the midterms.
 
Non-democracies are also guided by MVT. China is  bound by the preferences of the middle class. If US policy threatened its ability to escape the middle income trap, it would get aggressive. Short of that, it will be constrained in acting against the US because median incomes are the most important. The government's abandonment of Covid Zero in the face of protests is evidence of this.


**Economic Constraints**
*Greece and the Eurozone*
Economic constraints are keeping Germany in the EU. The Euro allowed Germany to depreciate its currency and boost exports. A majority of its exports go to the EU. If it were to leave, it’s exports wouldn’t be economical anymore. It exports far less to China and its domestic market isn’t helped by low birth and immigration rates. Target 2 are balances within euro area and show funds owed by the periphery to Germany. Explains why it continues to bail out poorer countries - it has the most to lose.

The Euro was put in place to restrain Germany. The previous model of fixing currencies to the Deutschmark gave them too much power. But the depreciated Euro is keeping them in and required them to bail out the periphery during the last crisis. An increasingly multipolar world is also keeping the EU together. They know they can’t rely on the US anymore, and they’re stronger together. 

The Greeks never seriously considered leaving the Eurozone. Even with a devalued currency, it would be hard to compete. It lost most of its exports to Asian competition, and by 2015, it mainly exported refined petroleum and mining products. As it’s manufacturing base was gone, it wouldn’t benefit from a devalued currency. It also would’ve needed FDI post devaluation which would be unlikely given the turmoil. They were also fully dependent on imports for energy, making a devaluation even tougher. Given the large public sector and number of people on pensions, a crisis after leaving the Euro would have led to money printing and possibly hyperinflation. The median voter was a pensioner and would demand more fiscal spending once they exited the euro. After staying in the eurozone they reformed and achieved a primary surplus. They had no choice but to become more competitive and lower labour costs and fiscal spending (note - this is a good model for Ecuador and El Salvador).

*Trade Relations and Multipolarity*
The Thucydides trap is often referenced regarding China and the US. The dominant power overreaches to maintain hegemony. Even regional hegemony (ie China over East Asia) is a threat as it allows the challenger to have a home base it doesn’t have to defend. Thus the “tragedy of great power politics” - the hegemon reacts to the capabilities of the challenger not the intentions. The intentions don’t matter.

When trade rules are being set up in a unipolar world, the dominant power only cares about absolute gains as it isn’t worried about its own security. The challengers are all concerned about relative gain and strike a harder bargain. As they prosper, the dominant power begins to care about relative gains more and starts to react to “unfair” trade treaties (eg Trump). In a bipolar game, both countries care about relative gains. The world is likely moving towards a multipolar world not bipolar given all of the regional powers. In that world, more countries care about absolute gains. They do this to remain competitive among a larger group of players. This means that your best defense is to cooperate with others when your rivals are also cooperating. 
  
A multipolar world is the least stable and the most vulnerable to mistakes (eg start of WW1).  There are too many rule setters. The US won’t be able to stop allies from trading with China the way they could during the Cold War. The US and China's lost share of global trade will prevent an all out trade war. **The need to maintain access to trading markets is an economic constraint preventing an all-out trade war, despite the rhetoric of the US.** 

In a multipolar world, absolute gains from trade matter more than relative. The UK, France, and Russia overcame centuries of conflict and ideological rivalry in order to ally against Germany in early twentieth century.  In the run up to WW1, Britain, France, and Russia continued to trade with Germany because none wanted to unilaterally give it up and cede profitable opportunities to each other. That is, they were competing with each other. They were scared to lose absolute trade gains to each other. Similarly, the US continued to trade with Japan after the latter withdrew from the naval treaty and up until it invaded Indochina. Similarly, the US, Europe, Japan, and Australia each want to maintain trade relations with China.   

Refer to Tuchman's Stilwell book. That book pointed out that the US continued to trade with Japan despite the China lobby because of the trade gains. They also wanted to use Japan as an anchor against communism from the Bolsheviks. 
[[Stillwell and the American Experience in China (1911-1945)]]
That was true of the Uk as well even though its colonies and concessions in China were at risk. They continued trading with Japan until the end because they didn’t want to lose trade gains to each other.  

This isn’t an issue in a bipolar world like the Cold War, because the dominant powers can stop allies from trading with the adversary. We’re moving into a multipolar world with power centers in Latin America, the Middle East, and Europe. Trump recognized this with the phase 1 trade deal with China which lowered tariffs in return for China not shifting trade to American allies. He also threatened trade wars with NAFTA and the EU making it clear that everyone was on their own. Biden has continues this with the inflation reduction and chips act which the EU has called protectionist. There are other examples; Japan is allying with Italy for its fighter jet program. India continues to trade with Russia etc. [[Japan Fighter Jet Program]]
[[Indian Defense Spending]]

This predicts that either the US will recognize the multipolar world and continue trading with China even up to a war breaking out, or it will give up gains to its allies by refusing to trade with China - further pushing the world into a multipolar one. Most likely China - US trade will continue even if war becomes more likely. Trump also tweeted that he didn’t  want to stop selling chips or aircraft parts to China in the name of national security because he didn’t want to lose trade to allies.

  
**Geopolitical Constraints**
Geopolitics mainly about geographical constraints.  Two main theoretical sources - Mahan (interest in American sea power ) and influence of sea power.

Trump's abandonment of NATO and EU almost led the US to cede Eurasia to Europe/China/Russia. US grand strategy was always focused on preventing this. This led to Trump begrudgingly accepting article 5. Trump recognized the world was turning more multipolar as did Obama, which is why he was competing with Europe. Biden seems to have ignored this and doubling down on hegemony. The author predicted that Russia wouldn’t have gone further than Crimea due to its dependence on Germany for selling its gas and the great military commitment required to hold Ukraine. He also thought MVT wouldn’t support Russia. 

This was before 8 years of US military aid to Ukraine and pulling Ukraine close to NATO. He underestimated the power of nationalism. He also overestimated Russia's reliance on Europe for selling gas. Selling gas earns dollars but If its reserves are stolen and it’s locked out of the US led system do you need to keep up your exports for dollars? You can sell gas to India or China. 

**Legal Constraints**
Legal constraints are the least important, as governments find workarounds when necessary
e.g. ECB bailing out sovereigns, US president passing something via reconciliation, etc
Reconciliation is a way to get a budget passed without  having 60 senators. Democrats and republicans have gone back and forth on rules against using reconciliation to raise deficits. The Byrd rule is supposed to prevent non-budgetary issues from being included. It’s also possible to use dynamic scoring to justify deficits without sun setting provisions. The bottom line is that rules can be bent to political will. Trump tax cuts happened because they were popular with the median voter. Obamacare repeal didn’t happen because they weren’t. Tea party rhetoric on deficit spending was always political.

**Time Constraints**
The analyst should tactically focus on the narrative in the short-term, and focus on the constraints for the medium-long term. A market friendly leader winning an election may cause the market to rally in the short-term even if he won't be able to get anything done. 

The market overestimated the danger of ISIS and impact of Covid. Constraints would tell you ISIS would be defeated and social distancing would come to an end. But you had to respect the market's fear at the time. Tactically it made sense to be short. Covid forecasts underestimated the number of infections and so overstated the mortality rate (same thing happened for h1n1 and Ebola). The CDC exaggerated the mortality for young people in order to scare them. CDC models ignored the impact of people changing behavior especially older people. 

The amount of fiscal and monetary stimulus in 2020 was the real story. Different than in 2007 or 2017. This is what the author calls the beunos Aires consensus.The median voter overreacted to Covid which forced the government's hand in the first stage. But constraints around public savings and employment would push in the other direction. The falling mortality and severity would also push parents to want their kids back in school.

**Net Assessments**
*Operationalize*
Net assessment refers to netting out conclusions from various constraints and form probabilities. These probabilities are your priors. The assessment tells you what are the binding constraints and what datapoints to monitor. As you monitor, update prior probabilities (Bayesian framework). Keep a checklist of these data streams, focus on the fulcrum constraints (e.g. new pipeline in Argentina, new refinery in Nigeria, etc.). You should try to be creative, and it's fine to use  subjective sources - op ed columns, google trends, poll results etc. The probabilities also tell you if there's any geopolitical alpha to harvest. 

There are 3 lenses for Net Assessments:
  
1) Discrete - specific events eg US' assassination of Iranian general. You'll need to react in the moment. Should make a list of possible events and conduct a net assessment of each so you can react accordingly 
  
2) Cyclical - medium term. Make net assessments for all relevant DM and EMs. Make a calendar of geopolitical events.

3) Thematic - long term e.g. collapse of USD as reserve currency. Think about what’s being taken for granted today eg a U.S. China conflict, End of USD hegemony etc. Conduct net assessments for any that you’re not 100pct sure of. The assessments will determine what are the relevant items to monitor. You need to identity the binding constraints (fulcrums) and monitor them closely Should be updating prior probabilities as more info comes in.

**Applying it to India** 

India, like China, used to account for a large share of global GDP. Colonialism ended that.
India’s main constraint now is the lack of investment. Investment can come from the government, private sector, or from foreign investors. 

Government sector - doesn’t tax enough and so doesn’t have funds to invest. Tax rates are too low. High levels of inequality - worse than the US - make rich people uneasy. They keep money outside the country. The ability to purchase oil in non-USD [[Clash of Empires Update Identifying Winners and losers]] could improve domestic savings. 

Corporate sector - corporate tax is high, but very few firms account for all of the corporate taxes.  

FDI- exaggerated by round tripping through Mauritius. Corporates use it to evade taxes. Has remained low due to **strict labour laws and the lack of land reform**.   

For india to repeat the East Asian miracle, savings and investment rates will have to increase. Savings rates are low partially due to an underdeveloped banking sector which fails to intermediate private savings And investment. High savings led to high gross capital formation. Check Dani Rodrik’s paper on premature deindustrialization. He says that due to competitiveness of east Asia and the advent of automation, countries reach their peak manufacturing capability before reaching high income. India has attempted to bridge the gap with services. But these can’t absorb the poor and unskilled. While service incomes are on par with middle income countries, rural and industrial wages (which account for 70% of ppl) are low. Rural real wages actually fell. Due to non-trade tariffs and the inability to export services, service growth rate is limited by domestic productivity growth. East Asian countries were able to increase productivity through urbanization. But services can’t absorb the rural poor the way manufacturing can. East asia also benefited from the developed world’s pro trade globalization orientation. This is reversing. If India focuses on consumption over investment it can still grow fast. But a rise in consumption without a rise in productive capacity will lead to a chronic current account deficits and/or inflation.

The goal is to determine the binding or fulcrum constraints. The author says the lack of investment driven by stalled labour and land reforms are the constraints. These are also what he monitors (data streams) to remains updated on the constraints. 

Modi’s push to nationalism instead of tough reforms shows where the median voter is. His personal preferences don't really matter (although Modi clearly is a nationalist). He isn’t interested in short term pain but rather social and anti-Muslim policies. This indicates that reforms won’t be forthcoming. The lack of investment and ethnic divisions bode negatively for india. Geopolitical context is good as it benefits from US/China conflict, and Pakistan isn’t a military rival anymore. But the key constraint is domestic. China-US trade war is unlikely (based on earlier analysis), and India will continue to import expensive commodities. 

  
**Iran/Us conflict** 
The US will accept Iranian regional hegemony due to geopolitical constraints (since it withdrew forces from Iraq) and the need to keep the strait open. And political constraints - median voter doesn’t support war. 

For discrete events, build decision trees and assign conditional probabilities. Thinking in specific probabilities often leads to better predictions. For medium and long term assessments, the goal is to determine prior biases, not probabilities as in the discrete events. 
Biases (eg bearish) and probabilities are then updated with new info (for non-discrete, info should be for binding constraints).

*Game Theory*
Game theory can be an interesting framework but the math can give a false sense of confidence. You jave to determine which side is more capable of altering the others utility function. Diplomacy is a 2 level game, the first of which is domestic politics. While material power determines each side’s pain tolerance, domestic politics drive the tolerance curves. China has a lower threshold than the US when it comes to trade, but its domestic politics give it more space and let it tolerate pain for longer. Assessing what’s possible domestically is important. Understanding each side’s material constraints is more important than game theory formalization.

While Greece vs Germany was painted as a game of chicken, Germany was able to play much harder ball than Greece. That determined the winner.

**Conclusion**
Geopolitics are outside of the domain of most investors. Most don’t understand politics and think leaders act irrationally (esp in developing or non-US Allies). They underestimate constrains and overreact. They also easily succumb to stereotypes (eg anti French feelings leading to overestimating Le Pen’s chances of winning, socialism in Latin America, China and Russia currently). Most took the wrong lessons from Brexit and trump and didn’t analyze what was driving French voters. The migrant crisis faded and polls shows most wanted labour reforms. They recommended buying the euro and long French industrials vs German industrials. These worked with Macron winning and the possibility of reforms. Generating Alpha requires playing the spread not getting every call exactly right.  

When engaged in geopolitical analysis you’re facing against investors who are relying on stereotypes. Even smart investors lose their rigor when it comes to geopolitics. They’re relying on stereotypes and meetings with officials who tell them what they want to hear. Constraints are actionable and not optional. They aren’t subject to preferences while the reverse isn’t true. Can use constraints to come up with a bias and then test that bias against evidence and adjust it (Bayesian). Need to find what’s priced in and remain objective. Want out of consensus net assessments. 

Have the Brazil and Mexico example. Investors loved the former and hated the latter based on ideological preferences and stereotypes. They ignored the median voter constraints they both faced. I see the same thing in Latin America today and with Russia. 
Need to focus on constrains to determine what’s binding. That’ll help you figure out what needs to change for you to get the outcome you want (if you have a preference). Sometimes collective psychology can change constraints like during Covid or previous terrorist  scares. Don’t be ideological about constraints. The framework itself is constrained.
