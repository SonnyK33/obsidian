There are 4 types of money -

i) Fiat currency (coins and bills)

ii) Bank deposits - created by commercial banks and fdic insured 

iii) Central bank reserves - created by the fed and act as deposits for commercial banks at their account at the fed. Freely convertible into currency. Can only be held by commercial banks). Banks can use reserves to pay each other or anyone that has an account at the fed   

Central bank reserves are created when fed buys an asset or makes loan. When it buys treasuries from banks it creates reserves. Banks replace treasuries with reserves in their balance sheet and fed has a new asset - treasury - and new liability - reserves 

Only banks can hold reserves, if a corp sells treasuries to the fed, the reserves go to the corp’s bank 

Pre-GFC there were only $30bn in reserves (vs a few trillion now) and the fed controlled rates by changing the amount of reserves in the system 

Now they control rates by the rate they pay on excess reserves and the overnight reverse repo facility 

Who holds reserves - 
	a) Commercial banks

	b) Foreign central banks (don’t hold reserves but have a repo loan). When they move money from banks to the foreign repo pool at the NY fed, reserves leave the banking system and go to a foreign repo facility account,

	c) TGA - treasury’s checking account (when ppl pay taxes, reserves go from banking system to TGA). 
	DR deposit liab
	CR reserve asset

	d) Other entities a GSEs, CME etc 



iv) Treasuries - issued by the treasury and convertible to deposits via repo transactions
