[[Like a Fading Shadow]]
**Summary**
Sisyphus is a character in an ancient Greek story. For his sins against a powerful king, he was sentenced to spend eternity pushing a rock up a hill. When he reached the top, the rock would fall, and he would return to the bottom and push it back up. This cycle would repeat forever. The implication is that to be forced to perform a mindless and repetitive task would be a horrible punishment. Camus' premise in this book is that every person's life could be thought of in similar terms to Sisyphus endlessly pushing a rock up a hill. We tend to attach great meanings to our lives-- to our family, careers, and activities. But in the end, none of it really matters. Everyone dies and all activities come to an end. Nothing has any grand meaning. Camus then asks if all our lives are meaningless, why should we go on living? The answer is that the meaning to life is to simply live. The "myth" in the title refers to idea that Sisyphus' life was meaningless. In fact, all of our lives have meaning. Just the act of going through the motions everyday constitute a reason to live. The book end with the classic line: "The struggle towards the heights alone is enough to fill a man’s heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy".

**Molecules:**
If you’re absurd but you know that most other people aren’t, what’s the moral thing to do? To just collect experiences like Camus suggests seems immoral, knowing that they mean more to others. Perhaps the fact that most other people aren’t absurd is itself evidence that the world isn’t absurd. That is, there is meaning because those we love believe there is meaning. By Camus logic, you should have as many kids as possible to maximize the number of experiences. But if you can’t spend time with them, they miss out. They expect love and affection from their parents. There is meaning there. The fact that they need and want parenting means that what you do for them does matter. A purely absurd world requires everyone to believe in the absurdity.

The idea of multiplying what you can’t unify is interesting. Reminds me of the idea of seeing something in many different contexts in order to generalize it. Because it’s hard to abstract, we try to experience as much of it as possible. Though Camus would say it can’t be abstracted. Pattern recognition is impossible because there’s too much randomness. Connection’s with the black swan idea? Too many exceptions show there aren’t any rules. Camus is long volatility. He’s long as many experiences as possibles. Expose yourself.

With reference to Plato’s cave allegory, Camus doesn’t think there’s anything to be revealed. What we perceive in the shadows is all that matters. There is no true form to be revealed via logic and reason.

Molina's [[Like a Fading Shadow]] explicity compares a writer's habits and mindset with that of a killer on the loose. He has to invent a new reality and completely believe it. Molina neglected everything that should have been important to him (his wife, his newborn etc) in the pursuit of loosing himself in the setting of his new novel. He was valuing experiences over profoundness. Writing fiction is an aburd experience.

What drives Sisyphus is knowing that fate is his own. He has free will and the rock is his life. While he can’t control everything he knows that this world was created by humans and is driven by them. There’s no higher power pulling strings. The mundane act of pushing the rock is analogous to all of our lives. In the end, none of it matters. But we still do it. We derive meaning and happiness from it. And that’s fine. We have moments of despair but we return to the rock. No one else is forcing us to return. Life is just a bunch of sometimes unrelated experiences.

Camus says that whether it's worth living is the most important question we can ponder. To commit to one's life is to admit to the absurdity of living. When we cite our age we acknowledge we exist on a timeframe and that there’s a destination-- death. We wait until tomorrow and then tomorrow comes. What’s the point?

What is true and what is false? If we say all is true than so is the contrary statement (ie “all is not true”). If we say all is false than so is that statement. If all is true except for contradictory statements, than that requires the very statement to be true and for this statement to be true etc. What does that mean? The world isn’t absurd. Rather it’s man’s tendency to be confronted by the irrational and then attempt to seek clarity. Trying to understand the irrational is absurd. Life is full of contradictions (like the true/false example).

To call something absurd, an expectation must be compared to reality. The extent of an absurdity is proportional to the difference between the two. Absurdity doesn’t exist in a vacuum. There is some standard to which events must be compared to.

Leo chestov was an influence. He didn’t believe in reason, but attributed absurdities to God. 
He says that it’s tough to admit life is one big void with no meaning. However one must accept that (if one accepts absurdism) and go on. Choose despair, but a “determined soul will always manage”. Quotes 

A key argument in the book (and I think existentialism in general) is that we should focus on what we can actually experience. All that matters is what we know for sure. What can’t be rejected. We know we can’t reconcile our desire for order with the true world.   

Can you be free if you know you will die at some point. Free will goes against the idea of a benevolent god as he allows evil acts to occur. The only freedom that matters is what you can experience and observe yourself. Being condemned to die (ie naturally and not through suicide) gives meaning to life. Suicide is defiance and accepting the absurd. There’s freedom in absurdity. You don’t have to fit any anyone’s standards or try to be a certain type of person. Death and absurdity are the only liberators. All that matters is living without appeal. Just go through the motions and not question why everything is happening the way it is. Live in the moment.

If there is no god, then I am god. While these seems like nonsense, this is the logic we all follow. If there isn’t some omnipotent force controlling everything, we are in control. This should feel liberating. He writes that man created God so that we didn’t have to commit suicide. That is, it’s the only thing that explains the unexplainable. If there is no god, then nothing makes sense, and life has no meaning - might as well kill yourself.

**Quantity vs Quality**
One consequence of absurdism is quantity leads to quality. Since all experiences are meaningless, the quality doesn’t matter. What’s more important is the quantity. Absurdism teaches you to have as many experiences as possible but recognize that none of them matter.
He doesn’t do anything for the afterlife. The more you love, the more absurd you become.


**Who is Absurd?**
He references Don Juan whose story I don’t know. But he argues Juan’s tendency to go from woman to woman while loving all of them equally was evidence of the absurd. Don Juan chooses quantity over quality - which is what an absurd man would do. He doesn’t believe in the profoundness of experiences. He knows that he’s mortal and so tries to have as many experiences as possible. The absurd man is selfish in that way, unless everyone else is equally absurd (my point).  

What is love exactly? Camus returns to his argument that he only knows what he experiences. Love is the thing that binds him to another person. But that thing will differ for everyone and so can’t really be called the same thing. The absurd man “multiplies here again what he cannot unify”. He’d rather just gather as many experiences (love as many people as possible) since he can’t really define love. He says noble love should recognize itself to be short-lived and exceptional. It’s don Juan’s way of giving. Is he the selfish one? There are no unifying concepts, just what we experience. It feels almost liberating (and Camus describes it that way as well). It’s democratic and not high brow. It’s deeply practical. Everything doesn’t need a label; it is what it is.   

The actor can be seen as absurd. Camus says he isn’t absurd per se but his fate is. Always going from one role to another. He loses himself in the role and then the character dies. He does this over and over again, getting as many experiences as possible. The traveler is similarly absurd. There was a time when actors were excommunicated from the church and knew they would go to hell. They chose their professions over their souls. They were clearly absurd. I don’t think he likes priests. That’s who I think he’s referring to when he says “you no wise deserve a privilege on earth and in heaven for having brought to perfection your dear little meek sheep". Absurdity is not about explaining and solving but experiencing and describing 

Art can be absurd if the artist doesn’t take it too seriously. The world would be the same whether he made the art or not. It can help you realize how blind everyone else is rather than help you see some eternal truth. The triumph of the carnal. Absurd art should renounce its prestige. If the world was clear there wouldn’t be art.   

Camus sees contradictions in art. On the one hand it’s the ultimate absurdity. It doesn’t mean anything or means something different to everyone. It’s also gratuitous and unnecessary. But it’s taken seriously by so many people. To be absurd, art must be aware of itself. It shouldn’t seek fame, it should just exist. It should invite description and not explanation. Art only exists because the world is absurd. Art represents the absurd but also represents nothing because it’s absurd. It takes thought to produce art, but at the same time it must be rejected as representing anything. That’s the paradox of art in an absurd world.

Fiction should fit in with absurdity. The author has to separate himself from his reality and focus on the basic elements of life. That is, what anyone can experience or observe - what you should seek as an absurd man. But like art, to be absurd, it must be aware of its own irrelevance. 

**In Writing - WIP**
Brothers karamazov ends with the mother saying we'll see each other again in heaven. Dostoevsky says that man must be immortal as it’s key to our existence in believing we’ll live forever. Else we’d kill ourselves. Similar to believing in god.

Scorn for the gods, hatred for death, and love for life earns Sisyphus his punishment. Every time he goes back down the hill to get the rock, he wins. Just by doing what he has to do. It’s tragic when he thinks about it. He feels anger when he goes back down, but he does it anyways. “There is no faith that cannot be surmounted by scorn”. The struggle towards the heights alone is enough to fill a man’s heart. You fight against the absurdity by living each day after the other.

We attribute tragedies to fate and our successes to our own work. Kafka manages to contrast the ordinary/logical  with the absurd.

Greek tragedies similarly use logical steps to lead to absurd outcomes. As in oedipus, where it is explained how and why he will commit the crime.
