[[Turkey - Outline]]

Turkey has too much FX obligations, though most of them are owed domestically. The central bank has $90bn in foreign currency deposits from Turkey's banks and another $40bn through swaps with domestic banks. So a total of $130bn has been borrowed domestically. There's another $120bn in TRY deposits with a guaranteed exchange rate. In comparison, they have $70bn in Eurobonds.

Total debt is relatively low (32% of GDP), but the key metric for Turkey is FX debt vs FX reserves. Effective FX reserves are negative if you net out deposits owed back to banks (and depositors). They have $50bn in FX reserves (of which 20bn is owed to UAE and Qatar through swap lines) and another $50bn in gold.
