**US Federal Reserve**
The Reverse Repo Facility (RRP) is a mechanism by which the Fed puts a floor on the overnight lending rate. The Fed sells securities held in its account (SOMA) and agrees to buy them back for a set price. The difference between the two is the reverse repo rate. The action temporarily shifts liabilities owed to the banking sector (reserves) into reverse repos. Treasury securities are held in the SOMA. 

The RRP drains liquidity; MMF's withdrawing from the RRP is an increase in liquidity and is analagous to QE. 

**Reverse repo with commercial banks**
Commercial banks with excess reserves (too much liquidity) can lend them back to Fed using the RRP and get treasuries as collateral. They sell the treasuries back to the Fed at a higher rate, thus earning the reverse repo rate. This temporarily converts their reserve asset into a RRP asset (i.e. a loan to the fed collateralized with treasuries). 

T-Account:
Fed - 
DR reserve liability (reduces liability)
CR Repo liability (increases liability)

Commercial bank - 
DR RRP loan asset (collateralized with treasuries)
CR bank reserves asset 

**With non-banks (e.g. MMF)**
MMFs who aren't eligible to earn interest on reserves (and who can't hold reserves) can earn the same overnight rate with the RRP. 

T-Account:
MMF - 
DR RRP loan asset
CR bank deposit (lends bank deposit to the fed)

Commercial bank as an intermediary - 
DR Bank deposit liability (reduces bank deposit owed to MMF)
CR  bank reserves asset (settles transaction with reserves)

Fed - 
DR reserve liability (reduces liability)
CR Repo liability 

MMF's make up 90% of ON RRP and continue to use it as rates are higher than treasury bills. Basel III has also pushed banks to rely more on deposits than MMF's for funding, pushing the latter into other sources of yield. 


Basel III -> banks shift to deposits and MMF shift to RRP

Covid stimulus -> abundance of cash means individuals are holding record deposits -> banks don't have to pay competitive rates on deposits

2022/23 tightening -> higher rates are allowing banks to earn higher spreads (since deposit rates aren't increasing) -> resulting in more bank lending 
-> also giving more interest income to individuals who are buying treasuries (when they do withdraw deposits)

Because banks now rely on customer deposits for funding and MMF have moved from banks to the RRP to earn yield, it will be harder to push QT. When individuals withdraw their deposits to buy treasuries, that's a decrease of liqudiity in the banking system.
