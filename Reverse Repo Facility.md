**US Federal Reserve**
The Reverse Repo Facility (RRP) is a mechanism by which the Fed puts a floor on the overnight lending rate. The Fed sells securities held in its account (SOMA) and agrees to buy them back for a set price. The difference between the two is the reverse repo rate. The action temporarily shifts liabilities owed to the banking sector (reserves) into reverse repos. Treasury securities are held in the SOMA. 

**Reverse repo with commercial banks**
Commercial banks with excess reserves (too much liquidity) an lend them back to Fed using the RRP and get treasuries as collateral. They sell the treasuries back to the Fed at a higher rate, thus earning the reverse repo rate. This temporarily converts their reserve asset into a RRP asset (i.e. a loan to the fed collateralized with treasuries). 

T-Account:
Fed - 
DR reserve liability (reduces liability)
CR Repo liability (increases liability)

Commercial bank - 
DR RRP loan asset (collateralized with treasuries)
CR bank reserves asset 

**With non-banks (e.g. MMF)**
MMFs who aren't eligible to earn interest on reserves (and who can't hold reserves) can earn the same overnight rate with the RRP. 

T-Account:
MMF - 
DR RRP loan asset
CR bank deposit (lends bank deposit to the fed)

Commercial bank as an intermediary - 
DR Bank deposit liability (reduces bank deposit owed to MMF)
CR  bank reserves asset (settles transaction with reserves)

Fed - 
DR reserve liability (reduces liability)
CR Repo liability
