Source: JPM - "B&G Foods - Refinancing considerations... 5/1/23"

BGS is a HY food company with a large exposure to edible oils. They recently acquired Crisco, increasing their exposure to raw materials like soybeans. Leverage is >6x and they have 2025 ($900m; 95 px) and 2027 ($550m, 87 px) bond maturities. Thy also have a 1L revolver due 2025 ($282 o/s of 800m capacity) and a 1L Term Loan B due 2026 ($610m).

The question is whether they can refinance the 2025 maturity, and if so, how. Given the revolver and TLB mature at the same time, all of them probably have to be dealt with simultaenously. an they issue a deal that primes the 2027s? After amending its RCF maintenance covenant, it's no longer in danger of violating it. For refinancing, the question is whether incurrence covenants will allow priming debt?

The 2027 debt covenant has a 2x FCCR ratio test, and limits debt capacity given the higher rate environment. The carveout for refinancing debt specifically excludes the 2025 notes. 

The capacity to issue under the '27s can be broken into:
1) Ratio Debt 
- assuming 9% cost, could raise $385m
- this is ignoring the fact that the existing 2025s would be taken out. If you calculate the 2025 maturity with a 9% coupon rather than 5.25%, that would still fit in the 2.0x coverage ratio.
1) General Basket
- $146m
2) Credit Facilities Basket
- 450m
Less: 97m existing draw

So total of $890m secured capacity under the indenture

Capacity to issue under the Credit Agreement:
1) Ratio Debt
- 4x FCCR -> 621m
2) General basket
- $36m

**The above calculations are wrong**
The indenture doesn't allow you to sum the ratio debt with the carveouts. What it's saying is that if the ratio test is not being met, you can issue under those baskets. But it can't be done in one transaction. You could issue once, exhausting the ratio test, and then issue again under those baskets. That's tough, as you need to make sure the subsequent issuances wouldn't get added to the pro forma for the first. 
If you could add them all up, it would say something like, the ratio will not include x, y, z, carveouts. It doesn't say that here. 


Total of 658m under the credit agreement.

So there isn't enough capacity to take out the 2025 maturity ($500m). This means they can't address the 25s without also taking out the 27s (or getting a consent). 

It's important to note how much of a difference the rate environment makes. These 27s were used to take out the 21s in 2019. The 2025 indenture had a restriction that excluded the 27s in its refinancing bucket. But given leverage was lower and rates were much lower, it was well within its FCCR. This gave it access to much more incremental debt, 

Given cross-ownership of the 25s and 27s, it may be possible to get consent to amend the '27 indenture. 

The Debt covenant restricts restricted subsidiaries from issuing debt. There isn't a restriction on unrestricted subs.

The RP covenant may allow it to create a new unrestricted sub if FCCR > 1.6x. The capacity is RP capacity + Permitted Investments (which is a defined term)

The most likely scenario seems like new secured debt. The ratio covenant would let it take out the 2025s at a 9% coupon. 


**Credit Facility**
*Leverage Maintenance Covenant*  - 
The revolver has a maintenance covenant that required total leverage to be under 7x. They were at risk of violating this and were able to get it amended to 8x through Q3'23.

*Ratio Debt* - Up to 4x net secured leverage 

**2027 Notes**
**Leverage Covenant**
*Ratio Debt* - 2x FCCR test

Credit Facilities - 
Max(200m, Borrowing Base)
Excludes the TLB/drawn RCF at issuance

*General Debt* - Max(125m, 4% of total assets)

*Refinancing Debt* - 
permitted subject to principal and maturity requirements ($ for $, and maturity must be after the refinanced debt or the '27 maturity')
Clarifies that the 2025 notes are not part of the permitted refi debt

**Liens Covenant**
*Permitted liens* - uncapped - allows liens for any credit facilities debt, doesn't have to be incurred under the credit facilities basket. Would allow loans or bonds.

**Restricted Payments Covenant**
The RP covenant seems to have a carveout for Restricted Investments if the FCCR is >1.6x. Could that allow for the company to move some assets into an unrestricted sub?
