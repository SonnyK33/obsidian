- molecule on broader lesson re: on global vol supresson
- low JPY vs other policy rates -> more expensive hedging -> should require higher global yields
- stronger forward JPY -> lowers hedging costs -> would allow for lower global yields 
- stronger spot JPY -> more demand for local rates/credit -> higher global yields (stronger Yen is inflationary)
	- large differential between USD and JPY policy rates increases hedging costs and should put upward pressure on USD yields 


**YCC**
On 12/19, the BOJ announced what is likely the end of the ultra-loose monetary policy by easing YCC and letting the 10y go to 0.5% from 0.25%. The change to YCC was accompanied by an increase in bond purchases, and the BOJ stated that this shouldn't be seen as a tightening but an effort to improve market functionality. They reiterated their stance to not start tightening until CPI hit 2%. A change to YCC was expected when the current BOJ head stepped down in Mar/23, but he chose to do it now (12/20) when the market was least expecting it. the JPY moved more than the 25bp change would imply and speaks to the psychological effect of changing a long-held position. 

The 10y and JPY surged, local and other Asian equities fell. Global rates are also expected to fall as Japan was the last holdout in raising rates. 

**JPY**
The change to YCC on 12/19 led to JPY strengthening. However, the weak JPY is also being driven by a growing trade deficit (and fiscal deficit) and gap in short-term rates. The Japanese policy rate is still negative. Importers are selling JPY 2 tr ($15bn) every month and trade deficit likely to widen from 3% to 4.5% next year. A weaker JPY actually increases the trade deficit as their imports are inelastic (primarily crude and gas). Largest export is autos which should be elastic, but maybe not now given surge in auto purchases last year, and likely deflation next year (i.e. costs falling for all cars)

**FX Hedging**
Japanese investors holding US bonds need to hedge the FX risk. 
The hedge makes money by the USD weakening and the JPY strengthening.

Hedge mechanics:
- convert JPY into USD in the spot market and simultaneously enter a forward contract whereby you lock in rate to convert the USD back to JPY
	- if the USD depreciates over the period, your FX swap will be in the money
	- the cost of the swap is the difference between the spot and forward rate
	- the forward rate will be a function of the differential between policy rates 
		- e.g. the forward rate is equal to the spot rate, but the USD policy rate is higher than JPY
		- you could borrow JPY, exchange JPY for USD in the spot market, invest USD in risk-free securities, lock in the forward rate, and then convert back to JPY for risk-free profits
		- this would cause a surge in demand for USD and strengthen the forward USD rate
	- on bloomberg - FXHCUSJP - represents the cost of exchanging JPY for USD in the spot market and simultaneously agree to convert the USD to JPY in the forward market 
		
Higher local yields make hedged USD yields less attractive, hence lowering demand for USD credit. Higher policy rates in Japan (which drive hedgers' cost of borrowing) would strengthen the JPY in the forward market, lowering hedging costs. That hasn't happened yet, so the net effect of keeping policy rates steady but raising 10y yields (which will increase corporate yields) is make hedged foreign yields less attractive. 


#Trades 
1) JPY as a funding currency. This is likely to unwind. Japanese investors own a lot of US credit due to the yield differential, but they hedge the FX. A stronger JPY will require them to increase their hedge which is already too expensive. This could cause them to unload a lot of US credit, particularly IG credit. 
2) Less demand for structured products which involve selling of options - more volatility 
3) steepening of yield curve good for Japanese financials
4) GS - 12.20.22 - JGB futures look cheap and are pricing in a -2% repo rate vs actual -30 to -50bp
	1) pricing in continuing challenges to BOJ in next two meetings (Jan and march)
	2) long vs CTD short - positive carry 
	3) next BOJ action could steepen 10yr curve further (not sure why? Should be expecting bear flattening)
5) short 5y JGBs - unless supported by BoJ, risk of rate increases at next meeting
