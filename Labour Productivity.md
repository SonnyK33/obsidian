Falling unemployment along with sluggish growth points to lower labour productivity. Previous episodes of low productivity led to excess pay raises and overly bullish targets for growth. Both of these imply continued inflation and higher for longer rates. Lower productivity also implies a higher share of income going to consumers and lower savings rates. This points to higher current account deficits in the US, and more dollar recycling into emerging markets.
