The USD as the global reserve currency has no useful precedent. This is due to the unprecedented role the US plays in global trade and capital flows. Trade used to be settled in gold or silver or in currencies easily convertible into gold or silver. 

The pound sterling was once the world's "reserve" currency, but it was convertible into gold. Whenever pounds outstanding rose relative to its gold reserves, the credibility of the BOE came under attack and they had to raise rates. 

1) In the gold system, trade imbalances must be consistent with the ability to absorb gold outflows
2) When trade flows reverse, the contraction in demand in one country turns into an expansion in others. Monetary outflows which force a contraction of demand will be an inflow elsewhere and will expand demand. So trade imbalances didn't put downward pressure on global demand. 
3) Trade drove the capital account, while it's currently the opposite in the US. 

Dollar dominance isn't just about what to denominated trade in, as it was in the 19th century. Today, it's about who will absorb global savings imbalances. That doesn't necessarily mean the US must run a trade deficit. During the first half of the twentieth century, the US ran surpluses, as the rest of the world needed foreign savings to rebuild their economies. That put the USD at the center of global trade. 

By the 1960s, Europe and Asia had rebuilt, and  wanted to absorb foreign demand (i.e. demand for imports) rather than savings to push their economies further. Because of the Cold War, the US may have been okay with this. 

So the end of dollar dominance means the end of the current trading system, where anglophone economies absorb all trade surpluses.
