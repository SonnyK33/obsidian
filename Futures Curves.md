Roll yield is the positive or negative carry generated by maintaining a futures position by continuously rolling to the next month. If the curve is in contango the roll yield is negative - this reflects the cost of carry - and is true for most commodities. If the yield curve is steep, the bond futures curve will be in contango which generates positive returns as bond prices rise w lower yields. You can generate positive carry when the curve is in backwardation by rolling down the curve and buying the cheaper next month contract.

Equity index forward curves are now in contango as forwards are at a premium since interest rates > dividends by a large margin. This makes it attractive to continually short the front month contract. This also means calls are overpriced relative to puts.
