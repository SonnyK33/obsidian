12.15.22
- tomorrow is the largest option expiry in 2 years with $4tr of OI
- in the last week, skew has gone from almost flat to 3.5 pts of downside skew (25DP to 25DC)
- this makes sense given yesterday's hawkish FOMC where Powell made it clear that rate cuts aren't coming in 2023 barring meaningful progress in inflation and the raising of the terminal rate in the dots projections (to over 5%)
- the increased skew indicates investors bought more puts going to 12/16 expiry
	- dealers should be short puts (negative gamma) so delta-hedging will exacerbate flows
	- they hedge short puts with short stock, as stock prices decline, the delta becomes more negative requiring more shorting of the underlying
	- the biggest strikes below 4000 are 395 (which we're below as of 9:40) followed by 3900 and 3800
	- per @AllGammaAllDay, there's major negative gamma at 3900
- can attribute hedging flows into gamma, vanna, and charm
	- gamma = how delta changes with the underlying
		- as described above, dealers are negative gamma, and so as stocks fall, they have to short more
	- vanna = how delta changes with ivol
		- if dealers are short puts, they're long vanna
		- higher vol increases the odds that the OTM puts expire ITM, that is it pushes the put deltas closer to -1 (negative vanna for puts)
		- if dealers are short puts, higher vol increases the hedge ratio, requiring more shorting of the underlying 
		- also applies to dealers being long calls; as ivol increases, it increases the delta on the calls (closer to 1), requiring them to short more stock
	- charm = how delta changes with time
		- deltas on OTM puts will get closer and closer to zero, decreasing the hedge ratio, and allowing dealers to buy back stock 
	- gamma and vanna will exacerbate moves, charm will dampen moves (assuming the biggest strikes are OTM)
		- vanna will reverse once the option goes ITM, hence pinning the market on the strike\
