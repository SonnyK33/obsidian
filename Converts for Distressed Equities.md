When a credit is badly beaten up, the associated equity will trade with minimal value and function largely as an option on the business surviving. In a last ditch effort to raise equity, the company may try issuing a convert. Because the volatility of the stock is (likely) very high, the call option deltas will also be high (vanna). This means that the strike on the convert can be far above the underlying price while still being ATM (i.e. 50 delta). This may be acceptable to the company, as reaching the strike price would equate to meaningful equity appreciation. The high delta means that convert buyers may be okay with a relatively low coupon.

This is true for call options on all equities with high vol and asymmetric outcomes (not just distressed equities). Because of the zero bound, the distribution of outcomes is pushed to the right.
