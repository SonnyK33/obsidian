The Crimean War humiliated Russia as they were forced to dismantle a naval base there. Nicholas was fighting for Christian orthodoxy in his view. Russia wasn’t on the European scene until the 17th century, with its takeover of the Baltics, Ukraine (new Russia) and then Crimea from Ottomans close to the holy land. Expansionism scared Europeans, and the British press was very jingoistic. 

Nicholas and his advisors constantly complained about western hypocrisy about Russian expansionism vs their own. Part of the anti-Russian attitude came from the forced conversion of people into orthodox Christianity.  

Gorbachev also supported Putin’s Crimea actions, and this was true of most Russians. Crimea is important because of history of empire, Sevastopol, and it was a holiday destination. When Kruschev gave Crimea to Ukraine, it was a symbolic administrative act. No one thought they could separate; it was similar to England and Scotland.   

After Crimea, Palmerston wanted to keep going and break up Russia. Napoleon didn’t and became allies with Russia. Sachs said his policy proposals for reconstructing Poland were all accepted and the US was willing to help. It was the opposite for Russia; it was the US' goal from the beginning to keep Russia down.
