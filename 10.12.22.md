CPI numbers are tomorrow, and the market is acting as if the outcome is symmetrical. I don't believe that's the case, as there won't be a chance to get out this time. I bought SPY puts today for the PA, as well as TWTR puts in case that deal falls apart. If CPI misses, stocks will be up tomorrow, but in the long-term stocks are still likely going down, and HY spreads are going wider. Oil should also be up if CPI misses unless recession worries really take over.
