Today was FOMC, and Fed raised by 75 bps as expected. I had some SPY calls (330 strike, 10 delta), and purchased some more during the hawkish press conference. I was too hesitant and bought them during the next hour at increasing prices, rather than at once. I need to get better at that. 
DISH is also bringing a new secured deal which takes care of the 2023 maturity. I also learned that they don't need to pay the full $10bn capex amount to avoid forfeiture of the licenses. This changes my view somewhat, as they could slow down capex in 2023, if the market isn't there to fund it. The key thing now is to look at both businesses independentally.
