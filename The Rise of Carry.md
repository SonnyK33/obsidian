Chapter 1 - Nature of Carry

Managing carry trades when they go against you requires buying in rising market or selling in falling market. This creates fire sale effects and amplifies volatility. The expansion of carry trades in a bull market makes it look more liquid than it really is. Because of central banks, the full extent of carry losses aren’t felt which encourages the trade to continue. They're more likely to help the wealthy and so they tend to increase inequality. Carry provides liquidity and credit to the economy, which is why it earns a return. It blurs the distinction between asset price corrections and recessions. Most argue the latter causes the former, but in reality, stocks don’t go down because of a recession, they cause the recession.  

Carry trades always involve leverage and are hence deflationary when the bubble pops, even though they inflate asset prices along the way. Central banks are captured by the carry regime and are forced to bail out those who benefited from it. FX carry trades shouldn’t make money in the long term due to interest parity but they do in the short term. Carry trades lures more investors in, leading to price appreciation but eventually lower carry

A local company borrowing in FX bc local costs are too high is also a carry trade unless the project will generate fx earnings

Bc ppl are complacent about fx risk they may continue to borrow in fx when local rates are too high

So projects that shouldn’t appear profitable because of the high cost w capital will appear viable bc can borrow abroad

Encourages more flows into country

And demand for credit increases

These flows appreciate the currency and hurt the current account 

When the flows stop the central bank has to use reserves to protect currency and prevent a crash

Happening in turkey right now

Eventually ppl fear currency depreciation and pull money out 

Procyclical peicess 

Low rates in us and Japan have encourages this

  

The US isn’t a natural funding currency as it has a large current account deficit and needs to import capital

Japan is more natural as has excess saving 

When the US is used to fund a carry trade that increases the current account deficit 

Only works bc of the safe haven status of usd

Foreigners continue to pile in savings

US funded carry trade requires that it continues as the reserve currency

Despite the net negative savings in the us, business have positive savings accumulated in banks

That’s what’s channeled to investments abroad

Side -

This means that policies that increase income inequality like regressive tax cuts which increase business savings will increase the carry trade 

  

Flows into EMs may be used for imports or to invest locally

The latter will push up the currency

Central banks

Who worry about losing exports may not want that appreciation so they’ll sterilize by borrowing in USD directly 

They’ll buy the borrowed dollars and dump their own currency 

Central

Banks acquire treasuries in this way

  

The money spent on imports may go to China who will also accumulate treasuries

Those treasuries finance the fiscal deficit and the cycle continues 

  

Going through this cycle increases credit 

The US finances its deficit and a Turkish entity increased its lira debt (either a corporate or the central bank if it sterilized)

The end result would be the same if the US had borrowed directly from a U.S. bank (ie the bank that finances the initial flow into turkey) and Turkish central bank had bought the Turkish corporate’s debt 

That situation which is not a carry trade

Wouldn’t happen bc neither the US or turkey would do that

But because of the carry trade ie the speculator that borrowed from a U.S. bank to invest locally in turkey the equivalent situation is able to occur

The speculators bet that the fx won’t depreciate more than the interest difference allows credit and money supply to grow in both places 

  

A similar situation occurs if a Turkish corporate issues a dollar bond (to finance a local project that wouldn’t be viable w local rates) and bond is bought by a U.S. fund who finances it w a U.S. bank

  

In turkey, the carry trade since GFC caused a credit boom that crashes jn 2018 and caused dollar rates to lend to turkey to go higher than interest parity would imply and caused interest rate differential below equilibrium

Turkey has been the most persistent carry trade since GFC

When the carry trade unwinds, the funding currency also melts up, along w the recipient country crashing

  

In the aftermath of the Asia financial crisis, the yen melted up 

At the peak of the bubble, Thailand had a 8pct current account deficit

The crisis was triggered by a Thai developer defaulting on a property bond denom in usd. The currency was pegged, and they tried and failed to defend it

Once the carry flows ended there wasn’t anything to fund the current account 

Domestic Asian banks were major channels for carry trade 

This led to other regional currencies crashing

  

  

This along w LTCM and Russia default led to Greenspan cutting rates even though the economy was strong

LTCM was selling vol 

He cited credit spreads and it was the first time they cited global stability and spreads as a reason to intervene

Signaled that carry traders would get bailed out

  

Similar to Asia carry trade, peripheral Europe also attracted flows as they were gonna be folded into euro 

  

Japanese carry trade grew more post 2003

BOJ was worried about it’s trade competitiveness and so it intervened again helping carry traders

  

Japan is a natural carry funder since it has a large current account surplus

Japans current account surplus in 2004 led to a large capital outflow

Bc it’s not the dominant currency like usd, a circular flow would be unsustainable 

Carry trade was a driving force of the current account surplus by depressing the value of the yen 

Japans role in the GFC isn’t understood well

The carry trades didn’t grow after July 2007

Japanese banks’ holdings of net short term foreign assets was a signal of the imbalance

Fluctuations are directional indicators of global carry trade

Swiss franc was another major carry currency but was mainly used by housefholda from

Eastern Europe to fund cheap mortgages

  

Australia was the biggest beneficiary of carry trade in 2007

GFC crash was short lived for carry trades as exchange rates quickly reverted

  

Post Asian fincancjal crisis, the countries quickly restructured their economies and went from big deficit to big current account surpluses

That didn’t happen post GFC

  

Euro became major carry currency post 2013

Can see this w net foreign assets positions of peripheral banks

Swiss franc carry trade blew up in 2015..

  

Chapter 3

Selling insurance is the classic carry trade

But selling house insurance for example should be uncorrelated w a fire

You should be able to sell insurance on multiple houses

In financial markets selling insurance itself may create the conditions for a trigger

They initially lead to capital appreciation’s which lures more flows and encourages leverage 

This creates an imbalance (ie the target asset restructures in a way that relies on more of these flows) that requires more and more flows

Eventually it reverses

  

Carry traders are providing liquidity like a market maker

  

Carry always leads to more leverage and should lead to more debt

This may not be captured by macro stats

Eg if someone sells a lot of insurance he has a contingent liability which he can’t honor

This may not be calculated in a banks credit stats

Carry does normally lead to more credit growth

Eg country a

Is a low

Funding country and B is a high funding

Capital will flow from A to B

This will lead to currency appreciation and attract more

May lead to a real estate bubble and increase demand for credit

This will be accelerated if country B has looser monetary policies and higher inflation as will lower real yields and attract more capital

  

Changes in global banks’ net claims on a country are a good proxy for carry flows at least directionally

Can find this in BIS data

Australia is good indicator for global carry trades

Can track credit growth there w carry trade

Spreads bw funding and lending rates will stay wide as carry bubble grows

Will start to narrow before a crash

In the end Australias bubble was sustained by ppl throwing cash into it (US volatility selling) rather than it getting lured in w rate difference 

  

Turkey crash

Has been the most extreme example

In the past foreign debt and current acc deficit would have forced restructuring 

Global central banks let it continue

Carry masks standard Econ metrics eg debt to GDP 

Carry flows inflate the currency and may push up Econ growth 

From 02 to 08, Turkish CPI rose 80pct vs the US 20pct

The currency appreciates by 35pct during same period 

Gdp tripled on USD terms

Made debt and current account metrics look better since gdp was denominator

Carry should be compensation for taking risk others don’t want to take

Central banks have encouraged many to get into trade without underwriting the implicit risk

Carry returns from currencies have gone down as interest rate differentials have come down

Historically spread was driven by Italy, Australia/New Zealand, and the UK. Those spreads have collapsed and are at all time lows in developed markets

Lower spreads among DM has pushed into EM where liquidity is much lower

Increases vol in unwind 

  

To get decent returns have to use leverage 

And risk controls force violent unwinds when limits hit 

Extends until a larger player like c bank steps in 

  

Money managers run levered books and tough to manage short carry book

If the event isn’t hit on time, you’re forced to lower your exposures as you have to justify a string of losses even if they’re small

Incentivizes to run long carry book

Different if managing your own money and you have more staying power

You don’t give back your bonus when carry trade explodes so makes sense to be long carry

HF have grown in last 20 yrs and due to leverage and trading frequency have an outsized impact 

As they’re incentivized to be long carry, adds to the trade

  

Swf also well suited to be long carry as have more Staying power

But don’t reward managers w same kind of incentives or use as much leverage

  

Banks haven’t been contributors to carry trade since Volker rule 

  

PE LBOs are the definition of carry trades

Investors could earn the same returns w a levered public portfolio but then would have to report the volatility

PE has discretion w reporting and can smooth out returns

Corporates are increasingly engaging in carry trades esp in EM

In the us buybacks have been a carry trade

Corporates engage in carry trades

Lending to subs in foreign countries

Profit sharing and stock buybacks also carry trades

  

HFT traders are making markets and hence carry trade

Entire financial system is now built around carry

Chapter 6

  

EMs are analogous to Marginal levered speculator in developed market

They rely on capital flows and will Demand liquidity in a crisis

Have been enabled by central banks and the IMF

Carry can be a lubricant and helpful to those seeking capital 

Problem is when it dominates and becomes exploitave between seekers and providers of carry

  

When central bank has authority to print base money it’s at risk of capture by carry traders which leads to a bubble. Carry exploits the decision making of the central bank and dominates all forces 

  

  

A levered short speculator who wants to maintain the same leverage ratio will have to trade with the market - buy when it rises and sell when falls

The cost to this strategy are proportional to the square of variance

Known as volatility drag

This is what he’s paying for the option of huge returns

  

If he’s not fully levered he may be able to trade in the market ie against moves

  

If levered and trading w the market, will be stopped out if doesn’t trade on own 

The amount of leverage your broker allows will also correlate w availability of carry trades

These speculators are paying for liquidity w their trades

The providers of liquidity ie market makers ar engaging in carry trade 

As leverage goes up, market makers can charge more for liquidity

More liquidity incentivized more leverage 

  

Theoretically returns for assets should be brownian - and independent from one day to another

Leverage breaks this mean reversion bc it can’t rise infinitely and when it breaks liquidity dries up and the trade becomes momentum driven

  

Carry trades don’t have lower returns but more skew and crash risk

Vol and by extension the SandP are themselves carry trades since the underlying is traded by levered speculators

The higher the expected return, the more leverage will be used and the higher the crash risk

In the extreme the liquidity providers will become demanders

An incremental dollar is most valuable when it’s lost needed ie when volatility is highest

Vol can be thought of as the value of money or liquidity 

Lender of last resort is the most important seller of volatility 

Ie the Fed is the most important seller of volatility and provider of liquidity 

  

Qe3 coincided w stock boom 

But commodities and wages didn’t increase nor did gold 

Qe3 was selling vol which is what the SP has become

Size of balance sheet is hence a proxy for moral hazard 

  

Fed swap lines during a crisis equivalent to intervening in fx market

Swap lines help foreign central banks which on lend to borrowers who have been in carry trade

Which effectively make the swap line itself a carry trade 

During times of distress the feds balance sheet grows as do the swap lines

Just replaces one carry trade w another and makes the Fed the biggest carry trader

  

Chapter 7

Monetary policy

Carry is inevitable but current carry regime is a function of central bank policy

Carry eventually destroys itself 

  

C bank arbiter of reserve balances which in the extreme affect banks ability to borrow

QE increases the money supply by increasing reserves - don’t think that’s true bc there’s no net change 

  

Divisia money - weighted average based on moneyness 

By that measure money growth in the us had been slow

Assets that can’t easily be converted to cash are less money like and have higher yields

As carry regime progresses and vol decreases yields also decrease 

This makes those instruments appear more money like and increases the money supply eg NFTs

In this way central banks can increase money supply more than you think

The power has limits though as when there’s a crash, those assets revert to non-financial again 

  

In long term carry regime is deflationary as exists at time of high debt levels by definition 

High level of debt will deter ppl to borrow more

Will slow credit growth and Econ growth 

And thus deflationary

  

Suboptimal allocation of credit 

Carry regime suppresses yields and implicitly assumes costs will be socialized through bailouts from central banks or imf 

Means that debt is mispriced leading to excess consumption over savings

Mispricing of credit and Persistence of low rates keeps unprofitable firms alive. Over time this leads to more debt, less savings, and lower real returns on investment. The latter keeps Econ growth and rates low. When deflation sets in, the demand to hold money increases. People and firms would be expected to hold more cash vs risk assets. Equity and bond holdings are still high though because people are searching for return and don’t perceive those as risky as they expect central banks to intervene in a crisis. As per previous note central bank actions have made more assets money-like. Worst of both - returns associated with deflation and risk tolerance associated with Inflation.

  

Because regime makes more instruments seem money like, the deflationary shock can be stalled.

But there’s always a weak link like mortgages in 2007. Carry regime extends moneyness to non financial assets. Turns all corporations into banks.

  

  

The carry regime can keep GDP high for long periods of time. As the economy changes to accommodate the lower rates, persistence of carry regime makes economy grow even faster. The economy may start to favor consumer lending for instance which will benefit more from lower rates and lead to even more lending in the carry regime. All of this increases the risk of a deflationary shock. More GDP in this case leads to lower GDP in the future - contrary to what economists tend to think.

When the shock comes

 Liquidity dries up and volatility spikes

As volatility can be seen as the price of money 

The price of holding cash increases and everything else loses its moneyness 

Causes a sharp repricing as existing money supply is insufficient - definition of deflationary environment 

In the end, central banks are weakened by carry regime 

  

Chapter 8

Business cycle smoothness is eliminating w carry bubbles and crashes

When one carry bubble pops action often moves to a new carry trade maybe one that still has some money-mess so the carry crash is delayed

  

In 2007 carry trade moved to oil also in 13-14

  

Oil carry trade

When the curve is in backwardation, carry traders buy oil forward and hope to earn roll yield as prices roll up 

Without the carry traders, if oil is expected to fall, forward prices will sell off which will cause producers to sell immediately at higher prices

Ie will propagate through curve

Carry traders prevent this and bail out high cost producers dependent on credit 

No different than buying their bonds 

Oil carry trade not backed by central banks but foreign  governments and so more vulnerable

Carry bubble often hides itself and makes standard measures less relevant 

The equity market will look fairly priced in terms of multiples but the underlying earnings have benefited from the bubble as well 

Same with leverage ratios 

  

When bubble pops and new one emerges it’ll be in a different form

Post GFC, the banks were made much more secure 

This pushes carry trade into corporations and non bank finance companies

Stock buybacks to boost eps are an example

This is apparent by the high corporate profits in a world of low growth and inflation

You should only want leverage in an inflationary environment not one w risk of deflation 

But those who took leverage were rewarded

Carry trades can be similar to Ponzi schemes as both require inflows to exceed outflows and crash when this ends

Carry trades though create excess consumption and investment whereas ponzi leads to excess consumption 

  

Chap 9

Trading with the market is replicating a long atm call option and the cost will be proportional to the volatility 

Trading against would be selling optionality and has positive expected value

Tends to be profitable to sell gamma or volatility at shorter time horizons and buying back at longer time horizons 

Means trading against market in short term b with market in long term

Bigger premium on index volatility and correlation premium

Ie trades richer 

Since 87 SamdP has had richest premium 

It’s expensive because of demand for liquidity 

This implies that it’s the most important carry 

trade and barometer of global volatility 

Made the us equity market the global source of liquidity and the last resort

Related to equity markets being inversely related to sovereign bonds

Is that true now?

  

Carry regime restructure economy towards consumption and speculation away from investment

Chapter 10

  

In a hypothetical anti carry world, it would be profitable to buy optionality 

Over time this would be inflationary just as carry crash is deflationary 

Chapter 11

  

Carry is a reflection of power disparities 

The worst credits pay the most for liquidity

 Carry flows from those who have power to those who need liquidity

Excess liquidity is at the heart of it 

Liquidity protects from ruin - ruin which is often brought by carry regimes in the first place

It’s a racket

Those w power will survive the crash

Cumulative privilege powers carry regimes

What the market “wants”

More carry, more entrenched power and less volatility 

Shouldn’t care what the market wants 

IMF and central bank swap lines perpetuating carry trade globallly alllows foreign central

Banks to bail out local borrowers

Swap lines and imf not just important for dollar amount but for signal esp from central banks since they can print unlimited amounts
