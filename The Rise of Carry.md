Follow-ups:
- why does using USD as funding currency count as a capital flow (and hurt the current account)?

Takeaways:
- Policies that increase income inequality like regressive tax cuts which increase business savings will increase the carry trade in emerging markets. Excess savings in rich countries (including the US whose businesses have surpluses) fuel bad investments abroad. Excess savings in Germany and Japan fueled bad investments in the US (like subprime mortgages), and many of these flows continue on to emerging markets. 
- Central banks don't normally purchase corporate debt. The FX/EM carry trade effectively allows foreign central banks (e.g. Turkey) to do exactly this with a US speculator in the middle. It allows money supply to expand in the EM as well as in the US (the carry trade increases the demand for US treasuries). 
- bank holdings of net foreign assets are a sign of imbalance and should be monitored
- Changes in global banks’ net claims on a country are a good proxy for carry flows, at least directionally. Can find this in BIS data.
- The last stage of a currency carry bubble is when people are just throwing money in to sell volatility rather than capture any rate differential (see Australia example below). This is apparent since the differential narrows right before the end. 
- EMs are analogous to marginal levered speculators in developed markets. They rely on capital flows and will demand liquidity in a crisis. They've been enabled by central banks and the IMF. Carry can be a lubricant and helpful to those seeking capital. The problem is when it dominates and becomes exploitive between seekers and providers of carry.
	- EM's typically run CA deficit and have to pay carry to get investment from developed countries. The problem is when the capital flow itself drives the EM economy. The key differentiator is the existence of profitable investments at the country's cost of capital (i.e. the cost of equity).



The Rise of Carry argues that "carry", that is, payment for providing liquidity in exchange for taking the risk of asymmetric loss, has transformed the global economy. It first discusses what carry trades are - trades in which you win if nothing happens. Many economies, particularly in emerging markets, are effectively carry trades. 

Chapter 1 - Nature of Carry

Managing carry trades when they go against you requires buying in rising market or selling in falling market. This creates fire sale effects and amplifies volatility. The expansion of carry trades in a bull market makes it look more liquid than it really is. Because of central banks, the full extent of carry losses aren’t felt which encourages the trade to continue. They're more likely to help the wealthy and so they tend to increase inequality. Carry provides liquidity and credit to the economy, which is why it earns a return. It blurs the distinction between asset price corrections and recessions. Most argue the latter causes the former, but in reality, stocks don’t go down because of a recession, they cause the recession.  

Carry trades always involve leverage and are hence deflationary when the bubble pops, even though they inflate asset prices along the way. Central banks are captured by the carry regime and are forced to bail out those who benefited from it. FX carry trades shouldn’t make money in the long term due to interest parity but they do in the short term. Carry trades lures more investors in, leading to price appreciation but eventually lower carry


Chapter 2 - Currency Carry Trades

A local company borrowing in FX because local interest costs are too high is also a carry trade unless the project will generate FX earnings. Because people are complacent about FX risk, they may continue to borrow in FX when local rates are too high. Projects that shouldn’t appear profitable because of the high cost of capital, will appear viable. These projects encourages more flows into country. As Pettis argues in [[Volatility Machine]], people confuse the direction of the causality and conclude that all of these projects are attracting capital flows, rather than the flows creating viable projects. 

As these projects continue, the demand for credit increases. These flows appreciate the currency and hurt the current account. When the flows stop the central bank has to use reserves to protect currency and prevent a crash. Eventually people fear currency depreciation and pull their money out. Low rates in the US and Japan have encouraged this. The US isn’t a natural funding currency, as it has a large current account deficit and needs to import capital. Japan is more natural, as it has excess savings. When the US is used to fund a carry trade that increases the current account deficit. That is, when investors borrow in USD, that's a capital inflow into the US, and increases the capital account.  This only works because of the safe haven status of USD. 

USD funded carry trade requires that it continues as the reserve currency. Despite the net negative savings in the US, businesses have positive savings that accumulated in banks, which are channeled to investments abroad. Flows into EMs may be used for imports or to invest locally (which will push up the currency). 

*Central banks*

Those countries who worry about a worsening trade balance, may not want that appreciation, and so they’ll sterilize by borrowing in USD directly. They’ll buy the borrowed dollars and dump their own currency. Central banks acquire treasuries and build their FX reserves this way. The money spent on imports may go to China who will also accumulate treasuries. Those treasuries finance the fiscal deficit and the cycle continues. 

1) US generates a fiscal deficit and sells treasuries
2) Some of these treasuries then flow into emerging markets where business are looking to borrow at lower rates
3) These dollars will then be used for imports, sending them to a major exporter like China
4) The local central banks may not want their currency to appreciate so they sterilize the flow. This entails them borrowing in USD directly and buying the dollars the local corporate borrowed. 
5) In either (3) or (4), dollars earned either by the exporter or the central bank will get recycled back into treasuries

Going through this cycle increases credit. The US finances its deficit and a Turkish entity increased its Lira debt (either a corporate or the central bank if it sterilized). The end result would be the same if the US had borrowed directly from a U.S. bank (i.e. the bank that financed the initial flow into turkey) and Turkish central bank had bought the Turkish corporate’s debt. 

That situation, which is not a carry trade, wouldn’t happen because neither the US nor Turkey would do that. But because of the carry trade, i.e. the speculator that borrowed from a U.S. bank to invest locally in Turkey the equivalent situation is able to occur. The speculator's bet that the FX won’t depreciate more than the interest difference allows credit and money supply to grow in both places. 

A similar situation occurs if a Turkish corporate issues a dollar bond (to finance a local project that wouldn’t be viable with local rates) and the bond is bought by a U.S. fund who finances it with a U.S. bank. In Turkey, the carry trade since the GFC caused a credit boom that crashed in 2018. This caused dollar rates to lend to turkey to go higher than interest parity would imply and caused interest rate differential below equilibrium. Turkey has been the most persistent carry trade since the GFC. When the carry trade unwinds, the funding currency also melts up, along with the recipient country crashing.  

In the aftermath of the Asia financial crisis, the Yen melted up. At the peak of the bubble, Thailand had an 8% current account deficit. The crisis was triggered by a Thai developer defaulting on a property bond denominated in USD. The currency was pegged, and they tried and failed to defend it. Once the carry flows ended there wasn’t anything to fund the current account. Domestic Asian banks were the major channels for the carry trade. This led to other regional currencies crashing. 

This, along with LTCM (who was selling volatility) and the Russia default, led to Greenspan cutting rates even though the economy was strong. He cited credit spreads and it was the first time they cited global stability and spreads as a reason to intervene. This signaled that carry traders would get bailed out. Similar to the Asia carry trade, peripheral Europe also attracted flows as they were going to be folded into the Euro.   

The Japanese carry trade grew more post-2003. The BOJ was worried about its trade competitiveness, and so it intervened again helping carry traders. Japan is a natural carry funder since it has a large current account surplus. Japan's current account surplus in 2004 led to a large capital outflow. Because it’s not the dominant currency like the USD, a circular flow would be unsustainable. The carry trade was a driving force of the current account surplus by depressing the value of the Yen. Japan's role in the GFC isn’t understood well, but it's instructive that the JPY carry trade didn’t grow after July 2007. Japanese banks’ holdings of net short term foreign assets was a signal of the imbalance. 

These fluctuations are directional indicators of the global carry trade. The Euro became major carry currency post 2013. This can be seen with net foreign asset positions of peripheral banks. Swiss franc carry trade blew up in 2015. The Swiss franc was another major carry currency but was mainly used by households from Eastern Europe to fund cheap mortgages. Australia was the biggest beneficiary of the carry trade in 2007. The GFC crash was short lived for carry trades as exchange rates quickly reverted. Post-Asian Financial crisis, the countries quickly restructured their economies and went from big deficit to big current account surpluses. That didn’t happen post GFC. 

Per [[Trade Wars are Class Wars]], one of the reasons for this is that the CA deficits in the run-up to the Asian Financial Crisis were developing countries with large investment needs. Many of those investments were likely coming to fruition by the late 90s and may have powered the export boom in the following decades. By contrast, post the GFC, the CA deficit was in rich countries (primarily the US, but also UK, Canada, and Australia), where the excess savings from abroad were being wasted on bad investments (e.g. US subprime mortgages).   



  

Chapter 3 - Carry, Leverage, and Credit
Selling insurance is the classic carry trade. But selling house insurance, for example, should be uncorrelated with a fire. You should be able to sell insurance on multiple houses to diversify your risk. In financial markets selling insurance itself may create the conditions for a trigger. Volatility selling initially leads to capital appreciation which lures more flows and encourages leverage. This creates an imbalance (i.e. the target asset restructures in a way that relies on more of these flows) that requires more and more flows. Eventually it reverses. Carry traders are providing liquidity like a market maker. Carry always leads to more leverage and should lead to more debt. This may not be captured by macro stats, e.g. if someone sells a lot of insurance he has a contingent liability which he can’t honor. This may not be calculated in a bank's credit stats. 

If country A is a low funding country and B is a high funding country, capital will flow from A to B. 
This will lead to currency appreciation and attract more. This may lead to a real estate bubble and increase demand for credit. This will be accelerated if country B has looser monetary policies and higher inflation as, it will lower real yields and attract more capital. 

Changes in global banks’ net claims on a country are a good proxy for carry flows, at least directionally. Can find this in BIS data. Australia is good indicator for global carry trades, and you can track credit growth there with the carry trade. Spreads between funding and lending rates will stay wide as the carry bubble grows. They will start to narrow before a crash. In the end, Australia's bubble was sustained by people throwing cash into it (US volatility selling) rather than it getting lured in with a rate differential.  
 

*Turkey crash*
This has been the most extreme example. In the past, foreign debt and current account deficits would have forced a restructuring. Global central banks let it continue. Carry masks standard economic metrics e.g. debt to GDP. Carry flows inflate the currency and may push up growth in the short-term. From 2002 to 2008, Turkish CPI rose 80pct vs 20pct in the US. The currency appreciated by 35pct during same period. GDP tripled in USD terms. This made debt and current account metrics look better since GDP was the denominator. Carry should be compensation for taking risk others don’t want to take. Central banks have encouraged many to get into trade without underwriting the implicit risk. Carry returns from currencies have gone down as interest rate differentials have come down. Historically spread was driven by Italy, Australia/New Zealand, and the UK. Those spreads have collapsed and are at all time lows in developed markets. Lower spreads among DM has pushed into EM where liquidity is much lower. This increases volatility in an unwind. 

Chapter 4 - Profitability as an Investment Strategy

  

To get decent returns, you have to use leverage. Risk controls force violent unwinds when limits are hit. This continues until a larger player like a central bank steps in.

Chapter 5 - Agents of Carry




Money managers run levered books, and it's tough to manage a short carry book. If the event isn’t hit on time, you’re forced to lower your exposures, as you have to justify a string of losses even if they’re small. This incentivizes you to run long carry book. It's different if you're managing your own money and you have more staying power. You don’t give back your bonus when the carry trade explodes, so it makes sense to be long carry. Hedge funds have grown in the last 20 yrs, and due to leverage, and trading frequency, they have an outsized impact. As they’re incentivized to be long carry, this adds to the trade.  

SWF are also well suited to be long carry as they have more staying power. They  don’t reward managers with same kind of incentives or use as much leverage though.  

Banks haven’t been contributors to the carry trade since the Volcker rule.   

PELBOs are the definition of carry trades. Investors could earn the same returns with a levered public portfolio but then would have to report the volatility. PE has discretion with reporting and can smooth out returns. Corporates are increasingly engaging in carry trades especially in EM. In the US, buybacks have been a carry trade. Corporates engage in carry trades by lending to subs in foreign countries. Profit sharing and stock buybacks also carry trades.

HFT traders are making markets and hence run carry trades. The entire financial system is now built around carry.

EMs are analogous to marginal levered speculators in developed markets. They rely on capital flows and will demand liquidity in a crisis. They've been enabled by central banks and the IMF. 
Carry can be a lubricant and helpful to those seeking capital. The problem is when it dominates and becomes exploitive between seekers and providers of carry.  

When a central bank has the authority to print base money, it’s at risk of capture by carry traders which leads to a bubble. Carry exploits the decision making of the central bank and dominates all forces.  

  

  

A levered short speculator who wants to maintain the same leverage ratio will have to trade with the market - buy when it rises and sell when falls

The cost to this strategy are proportional to the square of variance

Known as volatility drag

This is what he’s paying for the option of huge returns

  

If he’s not fully levered he may be able to trade in the market ie against moves

  

If levered and trading w the market, will be stopped out if doesn’t trade on own 

The amount of leverage your broker allows will also correlate w availability of carry trades

These speculators are paying for liquidity w their trades

The providers of liquidity ie market makers ar engaging in carry trade 

As leverage goes up, market makers can charge more for liquidity

More liquidity incentivized more leverage 

  

Theoretically returns for assets should be brownian - and independent from one day to another

Leverage breaks this mean reversion bc it can’t rise infinitely and when it breaks liquidity dries up and the trade becomes momentum driven

  

Carry trades don’t have lower returns but more skew and crash risk

Vol and by extension the SandP are themselves carry trades since the underlying is traded by levered speculators

The higher the expected return, the more leverage will be used and the higher the crash risk

In the extreme the liquidity providers will become demanders

An incremental dollar is most valuable when it’s lost needed ie when volatility is highest

Vol can be thought of as the value of money or liquidity 

Lender of last resort is the most important seller of volatility 

Ie the Fed is the most important seller of volatility and provider of liquidity 

  

Qe3 coincided w stock boom 

But commodities and wages didn’t increase nor did gold 

Qe3 was selling vol which is what the SP has become

Size of balance sheet is hence a proxy for moral hazard 

  

Fed swap lines during a crisis equivalent to intervening in fx market

Swap lines help foreign central banks which on lend to borrowers who have been in carry trade

Which effectively make the swap line itself a carry trade 

During times of distress the feds balance sheet grows as do the swap lines

Just replaces one carry trade w another and makes the Fed the biggest carry trader

  

Chapter 7

Monetary policy

Carry is inevitable but current carry regime is a function of central bank policy

Carry eventually destroys itself 

  

C bank arbiter of reserve balances which in the extreme affect banks ability to borrow

QE increases the money supply by increasing reserves - don’t think that’s true bc there’s no net change 

  

Divisia money - weighted average based on moneyness 

By that measure money growth in the us had been slow

Assets that can’t easily be converted to cash are less money like and have higher yields

As carry regime progresses and vol decreases yields also decrease 

This makes those instruments appear more money like and increases the money supply eg NFTs

In this way central banks can increase money supply more than you think

The power has limits though as when there’s a crash, those assets revert to non-financial again 

  

In long term carry regime is deflationary as exists at time of high debt levels by definition 

High level of debt will deter ppl to borrow more

Will slow credit growth and Econ growth 

And thus deflationary

  

Suboptimal allocation of credit 

Carry regime suppresses yields and implicitly assumes costs will be socialized through bailouts from central banks or imf 

Means that debt is mispriced leading to excess consumption over savings

Mispricing of credit and Persistence of low rates keeps unprofitable firms alive. Over time this leads to more debt, less savings, and lower real returns on investment. The latter keeps Econ growth and rates low. When deflation sets in, the demand to hold money increases. People and firms would be expected to hold more cash vs risk assets. Equity and bond holdings are still high though because people are searching for return and don’t perceive those as risky as they expect central banks to intervene in a crisis. As per previous note central bank actions have made more assets money-like. Worst of both - returns associated with deflation and risk tolerance associated with Inflation.

  

Because regime makes more instruments seem money like, the deflationary shock can be stalled.

But there’s always a weak link like mortgages in 2007. Carry regime extends moneyness to non financial assets. Turns all corporations into banks.

  

  

The carry regime can keep GDP high for long periods of time. As the economy changes to accommodate the lower rates, persistence of carry regime makes economy grow even faster. The economy may start to favor consumer lending for instance which will benefit more from lower rates and lead to even more lending in the carry regime. All of this increases the risk of a deflationary shock. More GDP in this case leads to lower GDP in the future - contrary to what economists tend to think.

When the shock comes

 Liquidity dries up and volatility spikes

As volatility can be seen as the price of money 

The price of holding cash increases and everything else loses its moneyness 

Causes a sharp repricing as existing money supply is insufficient - definition of deflationary environment 

In the end, central banks are weakened by carry regime 

  

Chapter 8

Business cycle smoothness is eliminating w carry bubbles and crashes

When one carry bubble pops action often moves to a new carry trade maybe one that still has some money-mess so the carry crash is delayed

  

In 2007 carry trade moved to oil also in 13-14

  

Oil carry trade

When the curve is in backwardation, carry traders buy oil forward and hope to earn roll yield as prices roll up 

Without the carry traders, if oil is expected to fall, forward prices will sell off which will cause producers to sell immediately at higher prices

Ie will propagate through curve

Carry traders prevent this and bail out high cost producers dependent on credit 

No different than buying their bonds 

Oil carry trade not backed by central banks but foreign  governments and so more vulnerable

Carry bubble often hides itself and makes standard measures less relevant 

The equity market will look fairly priced in terms of multiples but the underlying earnings have benefited from the bubble as well 

Same with leverage ratios 

  

When bubble pops and new one emerges it’ll be in a different form

Post GFC, the banks were made much more secure 

This pushes carry trade into corporations and non bank finance companies

Stock buybacks to boost eps are an example

This is apparent by the high corporate profits in a world of low growth and inflation

You should only want leverage in an inflationary environment not one w risk of deflation 

But those who took leverage were rewarded

Carry trades can be similar to Ponzi schemes as both require inflows to exceed outflows and crash when this ends

Carry trades though create excess consumption and investment whereas ponzi leads to excess consumption 

  

Chap 9

Trading with the market is replicating a long atm call option and the cost will be proportional to the volatility 

Trading against would be selling optionality and has positive expected value

Tends to be profitable to sell gamma or volatility at shorter time horizons and buying back at longer time horizons 

Means trading against market in short term b with market in long term

Bigger premium on index volatility and correlation premium

Ie trades richer 

Since 87 SamdP has had richest premium 

It’s expensive because of demand for liquidity 

This implies that it’s the most important carry 

trade and barometer of global volatility 

Made the us equity market the global source of liquidity and the last resort

Related to equity markets being inversely related to sovereign bonds

Is that true now?

  

Carry regime restructure economy towards consumption and speculation away from investment

Chapter 10

  

In a hypothetical anti carry world, it would be profitable to buy optionality 

Over time this would be inflationary just as carry crash is deflationary 

Chapter 11

  

Carry is a reflection of power disparities 

The worst credits pay the most for liquidity

 Carry flows from those who have power to those who need liquidity

Excess liquidity is at the heart of it 

Liquidity protects from ruin - ruin which is often brought by carry regimes in the first place

It’s a racket

Those w power will survive the crash

Cumulative privilege powers carry regimes

What the market “wants”

More carry, more entrenched power and less volatility 

Shouldn’t care what the market wants 

IMF and central bank swap lines perpetuating carry trade globallly alllows foreign central

Banks to bail out local borrowers

Swap lines and imf not just important for dollar amount but for signal esp from central banks since they can print unlimited amounts
