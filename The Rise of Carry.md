The Rise of Carry argues that "carry", that is, payment for providing liquidity in exchange for taking the risk of asymmetric loss, has transformed the global economy. It first discusses what carry trades are - trades in which you win if nothing happens. Many economies, particularly in emerging markets, are effectively carry trades. Low rates in money-centers have perpetuated carry trades in emerging markets; speculators can borrow cheaply in developed markets and invest in high return projects in emerging markets. The cost of capital in these markets is higher, but the ability to borrow internationally makes many unprofitable investment infeasible. The risk in these investments is that the exchange rate moves (exactly what the interest rate differential implies), but years of low yields have allowed the countries to build FX reserve buffers, effectively allowing them to prop up their currency. It gives a good example of how the low volatility regime allowed a carry bubble to build up in Turkey.

1) A US hedge fund borrows in the US and buys a Turkish corporate bond
2) The Turkish borrower invests the proceeds in a high return local project
3) The flow of USD causes the TRY to appreciate, which the Turkish central bank may sterilize by issuing local currency debt and buying the USD
4) This creates more demand for treasuries, making it easier for the US to continue to run deficits 
5) This makes it easier for funds to borrow in US and invest abroad, etc
6) If the central bank doesn't sterilize, a stronger currency will increase imports which will send the dollars to an exporter (like China), who will invest it in treasuries with the same result


Going through this cycle increases credit. The US finances its deficit and a Turkish entity increased its Lira debt (either a corporate or the central bank if it sterilized). The end result would be the same if the US had borrowed directly from a U.S. bank (i.e. the bank that financed the initial flow into turkey) and Turkish central bank had bought the Turkish corporate’s debt. 

That situation, which is not a carry trade, wouldn’t happen because neither the US nor Turkey would do that. But because of the carry trade, i.e. the speculator that borrowed from a U.S. bank to invest locally in Turkey the equivalent situation is able to occur. The speculator's bet that the FX won’t depreciate more than the interest difference allows credit and money supply to grow in both places. 

All carry regimes must eventually come to an end. When that happens, deflation is inevitable, as years of low volatility have allowed everyone to accumulate debt. When the bubble pops, there's a premium for cash. In that way, volatility is the price of cash (or money-like instruments). Carry regimes are about power disparities, as liquidity flows from the powerful to the needy. That's what the "market" always wants bailouts and a return to low volatility. 

There are some interesting insights when combining this book with [[Volatility Machine]]. The latter argues that emerging markets should initially run current account deficits to attract adequate capital to fund investments. The East Asian tigers post-WW2 are an example of this. However, this 
books points out that a very large current account deficit is a sign of an imbalance. Eventually, a local investment will go bad which will cause those flows to reverse, which will bring down the rest of the investments. One way to unite both ideas is to focus on the nature of investments being funded. In the run up to the Asian Financial Crisis, many worthwhile investments were made, even if they became speculative in the end. This is evident by how quickly the region bounced back. By contrast, in the run-up to the GFC, the CA deficits (and investments) were centered in rich developed countries with few profitable investments. The flows were powering pure speculation and excess debt, which is why the developed world took much more time to recover. A key differentiator is whether investments are pulling in capital (as in East Asia in the 1990s) or excess savings are being pushed into economies (as in the US and many EMs today).

Always be cognizant if your trade is a masked carry trade. Does it require volatility to remain low? If so, what could cause the flows to reverse? Does the existence of the carry trade itself make it's end more likely? For example, selling house insurance doesn't make a fire more likely. But if you're directly selling volatility, that will lead to capital appreciation which will lure in more flow and encourage leverage. This will continue, and the target will restructure such that it requires more liquidity (e.g. EM's restructuring their economies with more capital flows per [[Volatility Machine]])). This causes the quality of the investments to get worse, and debt to increase. This increases the likelihood that the regime comes to an end. 

Follow-ups:
- why does using USD as funding currency count as a capital flow (and hurt the current account)? When someone borrows in USD, that increases the money supply as deposits are created from the lending. Similarly, when the US government issues a treasury, that increases the broader money supply, and is a capital inflow. 
- Has there been a carry regime in China that's driven unprofitable investments? Counter-intuitive as it's driven high savings and low consumption. Excess savings have made borrowing costs low in China. Those savings are invested abroad (FX assets) or in domestic investment projects, many of which are not profitable, due to low domestic demand (which is tied to the high savings in the first place). They've also led to unprofitable investments abroad (e.g. bad loans to EM).

Takeaways:
- Policies that increase income inequality like regressive tax cuts which increase business savings will increase the carry trade in emerging markets. Excess savings in rich countries (including the US whose businesses have surpluses) fuel bad investments abroad. Excess savings in Germany and Japan fueled bad investments in the US (like subprime mortgages), and many of these flows continue on to emerging markets. 
- Central banks don't normally purchase corporate debt. The FX/EM carry trade effectively allows foreign central banks (e.g. Turkey) to do exactly this with a US speculator in the middle. It allows money supply to expand in the EM as well as in the US (the carry trade increases the demand for US treasuries). 
- bank holdings of net foreign assets are a sign of imbalance and should be monitored
- Changes in global banks’ net claims on a country are a good proxy for carry flows, at least directionally. Can find this in BIS data.
- The last stage of a currency carry bubble is when people are just throwing money in to sell volatility rather than capture any rate differential (see Australia example below). This is apparent since the differential narrows right before the end. 
- EMs are analogous to marginal levered speculators in developed markets. They rely on capital flows and will demand liquidity in a crisis. They've been enabled by central banks and the IMF. Carry can be a lubricant and helpful to those seeking capital. The problem is when it dominates and becomes exploitive between seekers and providers of carry.
	- EM's typically run CA deficits and have to pay carry to get investment from developed countries. The problem is when the capital flow itself drives the EM economy. The key differentiator is the existence of profitable investments at the country's cost of capital (i.e. the cost of equity).
-  carry regime results in the worst of both - returns associated with deflation and risk tolerance associated with Inflation. Deflation because of the debt that weighs down growth. There is an inflection point though through which risk assets perform well
- carry restructures economies ([[Volatility Machine]] makes the same argument). e.g. economy may become more geared to consumer lending
- in the interim, before the bubble pops, GDP growth can increase. In this case, more GDP growth results in negative growth in the future
- backwardated forward curves (e.g. oil) can bring in carry traders hoping to roll up the curve. By buying oil forward, you are giving credit to high cost producers; it's analogous to buying their bonds. In that way, playing for the roll yield enables other carry traders (high cost producers with high capex and financing costs). Without the carry traders, producers would anticipate lower prices in the future and sell now, which would bring down spot prices. There is some nuance here though, as the convenience yield is real and will keep the curve inverted. 
- When one carry trade ends, investors may find another one to hide in before the whole thing comes crashing down (e.g. oil in 2008)
- Trading with the market (i.e. with the trend) is long volatility and has a cost proportional to volatility ([[Second Leg Down]] makes the same point)




Chapter 1 - Nature of Carry

Managing carry trades when they go against you requires buying in rising market or selling in falling market. This creates fire sale effects and amplifies volatility. The expansion of carry trades in a bull market makes it look more liquid than it really is. Because of central banks, the full extent of carry losses aren’t felt which encourages the trade to continue. They're more likely to help the wealthy and so they tend to increase inequality. Carry provides liquidity and credit to the economy, which is why it earns a return. It blurs the distinction between asset price corrections and recessions. Most argue the latter causes the former, but in reality, stocks don’t go down because of a recession, they cause the recession.  

Carry trades always involve leverage and are hence deflationary when the bubble pops, even though they inflate asset prices along the way. Central banks are captured by the carry regime and are forced to bail out those who benefited from it. FX carry trades shouldn’t make money in the long term due to interest parity but they do in the short term. Carry trades lures more investors in, leading to price appreciation but eventually lower carry


Chapter 2 - Currency Carry Trades

A local company borrowing in FX because local interest costs are too high is also a carry trade unless the project will generate FX earnings. Because people are complacent about FX risk, they may continue to borrow in FX when local rates are too high. Projects that shouldn’t appear profitable because of the high cost of capital, will appear viable. These projects encourages more flows into country. As Pettis argues in [[Volatility Machine]], people confuse the direction of the causality and conclude that all of these projects are attracting capital flows, rather than the flows creating viable projects. 

As these projects continue, the demand for credit increases. These flows appreciate the currency and hurt the current account. When the flows stop the central bank has to use reserves to protect currency and prevent a crash. Eventually people fear currency depreciation and pull their money out. Low rates in the US and Japan have encouraged this. The US isn’t a natural funding currency, as it has a large current account deficit and needs to import capital. Japan is more natural, as it has excess savings. When the US is used to fund a carry trade that increases the current account deficit. That is, when investors borrow in USD, that's a capital inflow into the US, and increases the capital account.  This only works because of the safe haven status of USD. 

USD funded carry trade requires that it continues as the reserve currency. Despite the net negative savings in the US, businesses have positive savings that accumulated in banks, which are channeled to investments abroad. Flows into EMs may be used for imports or to invest locally (which will push up the currency). 

*Central banks*

Those countries who worry about a worsening trade balance, may not want that appreciation, and so they’ll sterilize by borrowing in USD directly. They’ll buy the borrowed dollars and dump their own currency. Central banks acquire treasuries and build their FX reserves this way. The money spent on imports may go to China who will also accumulate treasuries. Those treasuries finance the fiscal deficit and the cycle continues. 

1) US generates a fiscal deficit and sells treasuries
2) Some of these treasuries then flow into emerging markets where business are looking to borrow at lower rates
3) These dollars will then be used for imports, sending them to a major exporter like China
4) The local central banks may not want their currency to appreciate so they sterilize the flow. This entails them borrowing in USD directly and buying the dollars the local corporate borrowed. 
5) In either (3) or (4), dollars earned either by the exporter or the central bank will get recycled back into treasuries

Going through this cycle increases credit. The US finances its deficit and a Turkish entity increased its Lira debt (either a corporate or the central bank if it sterilized). The end result would be the same if the US had borrowed directly from a U.S. bank (i.e. the bank that financed the initial flow into turkey) and Turkish central bank had bought the Turkish corporate’s debt. 

That situation, which is not a carry trade, wouldn’t happen because neither the US nor Turkey would do that. But because of the carry trade, i.e. the speculator that borrowed from a U.S. bank to invest locally in Turkey the equivalent situation is able to occur. The speculator's bet that the FX won’t depreciate more than the interest difference allows credit and money supply to grow in both places. 

A similar situation occurs if a Turkish corporate issues a dollar bond (to finance a local project that wouldn’t be viable with local rates) and the bond is bought by a U.S. fund who finances it with a U.S. bank. In Turkey, the carry trade since the GFC caused a credit boom that crashed in 2018. This caused dollar rates to lend to turkey to go higher than interest parity would imply and caused interest rate differential below equilibrium. Turkey has been the most persistent carry trade since the GFC. When the carry trade unwinds, the funding currency also melts up, along with the recipient country crashing.  

In the aftermath of the Asia financial crisis, the Yen melted up. At the peak of the bubble, Thailand had an 8% current account deficit. The crisis was triggered by a Thai developer defaulting on a property bond denominated in USD. The currency was pegged, and they tried and failed to defend it. Once the carry flows ended there wasn’t anything to fund the current account. Domestic Asian banks were the major channels for the carry trade. This led to other regional currencies crashing. 

This, along with LTCM (who was selling volatility) and the Russia default, led to Greenspan cutting rates even though the economy was strong. He cited credit spreads and it was the first time they cited global stability and spreads as a reason to intervene. This signaled that carry traders would get bailed out. Similar to the Asia carry trade, peripheral Europe also attracted flows as they were going to be folded into the Euro.   

The Japanese carry trade grew more post-2003. The BOJ was worried about its trade competitiveness, and so it intervened again helping carry traders. Japan is a natural carry funder since it has a large current account surplus. Japan's current account surplus in 2004 led to a large capital outflow. Because it’s not the dominant currency like the USD, a circular flow would be unsustainable. The carry trade was a driving force of the current account surplus by depressing the value of the Yen. Japan's role in the GFC isn’t understood well, but it's instructive that the JPY carry trade didn’t grow after July 2007. Japanese banks’ holdings of net short term foreign assets was a signal of the imbalance. 

These fluctuations are directional indicators of the global carry trade. The Euro became major carry currency post 2013. This can be seen with net foreign asset positions of peripheral banks. Swiss franc carry trade blew up in 2015. The Swiss franc was another major carry currency but was mainly used by households from Eastern Europe to fund cheap mortgages. Australia was the biggest beneficiary of the carry trade in 2007. The GFC crash was short lived for carry trades as exchange rates quickly reverted. Post-Asian Financial crisis, the countries quickly restructured their economies and went from big deficit to big current account surpluses. That didn’t happen post GFC. 

Per [[Trade Wars are Class Wars - WIP]], one of the reasons for this is that the CA deficits in the run-up to the Asian Financial Crisis were developing countries with large investment needs. Many of those investments were likely coming to fruition by the late 90s and may have powered the export boom in the following decades. By contrast, post the GFC, the CA deficit was in rich countries (primarily the US, but also UK, Canada, and Australia), where the excess savings from abroad were being wasted on bad investments (e.g. US subprime mortgages).   

Chapter 3 - Carry, Leverage, and Credit
Selling insurance is the classic carry trade. But selling house insurance, for example, should be uncorrelated with a fire. You should be able to sell insurance on multiple houses to diversify your risk. In financial markets selling insurance itself may create the conditions for a trigger. Volatility selling initially leads to capital appreciation which lures more flows and encourages leverage. This creates an imbalance (i.e. the target asset restructures in a way that relies on more of these flows) that requires more and more flows. Eventually it reverses. Carry traders are providing liquidity like a market maker. Carry always leads to more leverage and should lead to more debt. This may not be captured by macro stats, e.g. if someone sells a lot of insurance he has a contingent liability which he can’t honor. This may not be calculated in a bank's credit stats. 

If country A is a low funding country and B is a high funding country, capital will flow from A to B. 
This will lead to currency appreciation and attract more. This may lead to a real estate bubble and increase demand for credit. This will be accelerated if country B has looser monetary policies and higher inflation as, it will lower real yields and attract more capital. 

Changes in global banks’ net claims on a country are a good proxy for carry flows, at least directionally. Can find this in BIS data. Australia is good indicator for global carry trades, and you can track credit growth there with the carry trade. Spreads between funding and lending rates will stay wide as the carry bubble grows. They will start to narrow before a crash. In the end, Australia's bubble was sustained by people throwing cash into it (US volatility selling) rather than it getting lured in with a rate differential.  
 

*Turkey crash*
This has been the most extreme example. In the past, foreign debt and current account deficits would have forced a restructuring. Global central banks let it continue. Carry masks standard economic metrics e.g. debt to GDP. Carry flows inflate the currency and may push up growth in the short-term. From 2002 to 2008, Turkish CPI rose 80pct vs 20pct in the US. The currency appreciated by 35pct during same period. GDP tripled in USD terms. This made debt and current account metrics look better since GDP was the denominator. Carry should be compensation for taking risk others don’t want to take. Central banks have encouraged many to get into trade without underwriting the implicit risk. Carry returns from currencies have gone down as interest rate differentials have come down. Historically spread was driven by Italy, Australia/New Zealand, and the UK. Those spreads have collapsed and are at all time lows in developed markets. Lower spreads among DM has pushed into EM where liquidity is much lower. This increases volatility in an unwind. 

Chapter 4 - Profitability as an Investment Strategy

To get decent returns, you have to use leverage. Risk controls force violent unwinds when limits are hit. This continues until a larger player like a central bank steps in.

Chapter 5 - Agents of Carry

Money managers run levered books, and it's tough to manage a short carry book. If the event isn’t hit on time, you’re forced to lower your exposures, as you have to justify a string of losses even if they’re small. This incentivizes you to run a long carry book. It's different if you're managing your own money and you have more staying power. You don’t give back your bonus when the carry trade explodes, so it makes sense to be long carry. Hedge funds have grown in the last 20 yrs, and due to leverage, and trading frequency, they have an outsized impact. As they’re incentivized to be long carry, this adds to the trade.  

SWF are also well suited to be long carry as they have more staying power. They  don’t reward managers with same kind of incentives or use as much leverage though.  Banks haven’t been contributors to the carry trade since the Volcker rule.   

PE LBOs are the definition of carry trades. Investors could earn the same returns with a levered public portfolio but then would have to report the volatility. PE has discretion with reporting and can smooth out returns. Corporates are increasingly engaging in carry trades especially in EM. In the US, buybacks have been a carry trade. Corporates engage in carry trades by lending to subs in foreign countries. Profit sharing and stock buybacks are also carry trades.

HFT traders are making markets and hence run carry trades. The entire financial system is now built around carry.

Chapter 6 - Fundamental Nature of the Carry Regime
 

EMs are analogous to marginal levered speculators in developed markets. They rely on capital flows and will demand liquidity in a crisis. They've been enabled by central banks and the IMF. Carry can be a lubricant and helpful to those seeking capital. The problem is when it dominates and becomes exploitive between seekers and providers of carry.  

When a central bank has the authority to print base money, it’s at risk of capture by carry traders which leads to a bubble. Carry exploits the decision making of the central bank and dominates all forces.    

A levered short speculator who wants to maintain the same leverage ratio will have to trade with the market. He'll buy when it rises and sell when falls. The cost to this strategy is proportional to the square of variance. This is known as volatility drag. This is what he pays for the option of huge returns. Trading with the market (or the trend) is hence long volatility. The other side - trading against the market - is analogous to delta hedging a short option position. You make money in that situation as long as realized volatility is below implied volatility.  

If levered and trading with the market, you could get stopped out if the market moves against you. The amount of leverage your broker allows will also correlate with the availability of carry trades. These speculators are paying for liquidity with their trades. 
The providers of liquidity i.e. the market makers are engaging in a carry trade. As leverage goes up, market makers can charge more for liquidity. More liquidity hence incentivizes more leverage. Theoretically returns for assets should be brownian and independent from one day to another. Leverage breaks this mean reversion because it can’t rise infinitely and when it breaks liquidity dries up and the trade becomes momentum driven.  

Carry trades don’t have lower returns but more skew and crash risk. Volatility and by extension the S&P are themselves carry trades since the underlying is traded by levered speculators. The higher the expected return, the more leverage will be used and the higher the crash risk. In the extreme, the liquidity providers will become demanders. An incremental dollar is most valuable when it’s most needed i.e. when volatility is highest. Vol can hence be thought of as the value of money or liquidity. The lender of last resort is the most important seller of volatility. The Fed is the most important seller of volatility and provider of liquidity. 

QE3 coincided with a stock boom,  but commodities and wages didn’t increase nor did gold. QE3 was selling vol which is what the S&P has become. The size of the balance sheet is hence a proxy for moral hazard. Fed swap lines during a crisis are equivalent to intervening in FX markets. Swap lines help foreign central banks which on-lend to borrowers who have been in the carry trade, which effectively make the swap line itself a carry trade. During times of distress the feds balance sheet grows as does the swap lines. Just replaces one carry trade with another and makes the Fed the biggest carry trader.


Chapter 7 - Monetary Ramifications

Carry is inevitable, but the current carry regime is a function of central bank policy. Central banks are arbiters of reserve balances which affects banks ability to borrow. QE increases the money supply by increasing reserves  (this is only true to the extent that it increases lending). "Divisia" money is a measure which weights money by its moneyness. By that measure money growth in the US had been slow. Assets that can’t easily be converted to cash are less money like and have higher yields. As the carry regime progresses and volatility decreases yields also decrease. This makes those instruments appear more money like and increases the money supply eg NFTs. In this way central banks can increase money supply more than you think. The power has limits though as when there’s a crash, those assets lose their money-ness. 

In the long term, the carry regime is deflationary as it exists at time of high debt levels, by definition. The high level of debt will deter people from borrowing more and will slow credit  and economic growth, hence deflationary. 

It results in a suboptimal allocation of credit. The carry regime suppresses yields and implicitly assumes costs will be socialized through bailouts from central banks or IMF. This means that debt is mispriced, leading to excess consumption over savings. The mispricing of credit and the persistence of low rates keeps unprofitable firms alive. Over time this leads to more debt, less savings, and lower real returns on investment. The latter keeps economic growth and rates low. When deflation sets in, the demand to hold money increases. People and firms would be expected to hold more cash vs risk assets. Equity and bond holdings are still high though because people are searching for return and don’t perceive those as risky as they expect central banks to intervene in a crisis (since central bank actions have made more assets money-like). This gives the worst of both - returns associated with deflation and risk tolerance associated with Inflation.

Because the regime makes more instruments seem money like, the deflationary shock can be stalled. But there’s always a weak link like mortgages in 2007. Carry regime extends moneyness to non financial assets and turns all corporations into banks. The carry regime can keep GDP high for long periods of time. As the economy changes to accommodate the lower rates, the persistence of carry regime makes economy grow even faster. The economy may start to favor consumer lending for instance which will benefit more from lower rates and lead to even more lending in the carry regime. All of this increases the risk of a deflationary shock. More GDP in this case leads to lower GDP in the future and is contrary to what economists tend to think.

When the shock comes, liquidity dries up and volatility spikes. As volatility can be seen as the price of money, the price of holding cash increases and everything else loses its moneyness. This causes a sharp repricing as existing money supply is insufficient, which is the definition of a deflationary environment. In the end, central banks are weakened by carry regime.

  

Chapter 8 - Financial Bubbles

Business cycle smoothness is eliminated with carry bubbles and crashes. When one carry bubble pops, action often moves to a new carry trade maybe one that still has some money-mess so the carry crash is delayed. In 2007 carry trade moved to oil; this also occurred in 2013-14.  

**Oil carry trade**

When the curve is in backwardation, carry traders buy oil forward and hope to earn roll yield as prices roll up. Without the carry traders, if oil is expected to fall, forward prices will sell off which will cause producers to sell immediately at higher prices. This will then cause spot prices to fall. 
Carry traders prevent this and bail out high cost producers dependent on credit and is no different than buying their bonds. The oil carry trade is not backed by central banks but foreign  governments and so it's more vulnerable. 

The carry bubble often hides itself and makes standard measures less relevant. The equity market will look fairly priced in terms of multiples but the underlying earnings have benefited from the bubble as well (same with leverage ratios).  When bubble pops, and a new one emerges it’ll be in a different form. Post GFC, the banks were made much more secure. This pushed the carry trade into corporations and non-bank finance companies. Stock buybacks to boost eps are another example.

This is apparent by the high corporate profits in a world of low growth and inflation (i.e. profits have been boosted by the carry trade). You should only want leverage in an inflationary environment not one with the risk of deflation. But those who took leverage were rewarded. 

Carry trades can be similar to Ponzi schemes as both require inflows to exceed outflows and crash when this ends. Carry trades though create excess consumption and investment whereas ponzi schemes only lead to excess consumption.   

Chapter 9 - Carry in Structure of Volatility
Trading with the market is replicating a long ATM call option and the cost will be proportional to the volatility. Trading against would be selling optionality and has positive expected value. It tends to be profitable to sell gamma or volatility at shorter time horizons and buying back at longer time horizons. This means trading against market in short term but with the market in the long term. There's a bigger premium on index volatility and correlation premium for longer time horizons, i.e. it trades richer. Since 1987 S&P has had the richest premium because of the demand for liquidity. This implies that it’s the most important carry trade and a barometer of global volatility. This has made the US equity market the global source of liquidity and the last resort. This may be related to equity markets being inversely related to sovereign bonds (Is that true now?) The carry regime restructures the economy towards consumption and speculation away from investment.

Chapter 10 -Does Carry have to Exist

In a hypothetical anti-carry world, it would be profitable to buy optionality. Over time this would be inflationary just as carry crash is deflationary. 

Chapter 11 - Power
Chapter 12 - Globalization of Carry 
  
Carry is a reflection of power disparities, as it  flows from those who have power to those who need liquidity. The worst credits pay the most for liquidity. Liquidity protects you from ruin, which is often brought by carry regimes in the first place (it’s a racket).

Those with power will survive the crash. This cumulative privilege powers carry regimes. When people talk about what the market “wants”, what they mean is more carry, more entrenched power and less volatility; policymakers shouldn’t care what the market wants. The IMF and central bank swap lines perpetuate carry trade globally. They allow foreign central banks to bail out local borrowers. Swap lines and the IMF are not just important for the liquidity, but for the signaling effect. Backing from central banks is valuable as they can print unlimited amounts.
