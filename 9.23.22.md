Two days after [[FOMC]], stocks are down again, along with oil and gold. Rates are finally rallying, but 2yr rates are still above 4%. Pakistan 22s are in the mid-80s with rating agency downgrade and fears of a default. [[Pakistan]] has the cash (IMF and Saudi money), but the fear now is that they'll choose to default given the torrential floods, high commodity prices, and political crises. Next on the potential default list could be Ghana and [[Egypt]]. I'm having a lot of remorse over missing the S&P [[puts]] on wednesday. I made two stupid mistakes - I didn't realize my prices were delayed at first, and two when I did, was unwilling to pay the ask price ($3.50 vs my initial $3 bid). They're now close to $10. Lesson learned. One thing to always remember is that when a major sell-off happens, everything goes down - including gold, and even rates initially.
