**Thoughts on Hawaii's Conquest**
Hawaii was founded by Polynesians travelling from other islands in the South Pacific. This occurred sometime between 124 and 1120 AD. The islands had little to no contact with the rest of the world for at least 500 years. During this period, a distinct societies formed on the different islands. They were hierarchical and were led by kings and a nobility. The kings fought with each other for control of the other islands and for natural resources. Life was bloody and violent with brutal war, punctuated by the killings of innocent men, women, and children. Cannibalism was practiced, and no one was spared after a group was defeated.  

King Kamehameha unified the islands and is the father of Hawaii so to speak. He also ended "Kapu" which was a code of conduct requiring adherence to various taboos. Hawaii was a feudal system with landlords controlling large swathes of land and commoners forced to work the land. 

Captain Cook, a British explorer, stumbled upon Hawaii in the late 1700s. He was killed there after getting into a fight with locals. Starting in the early 1800s, sugar became a major export from Hawaii. Planters from the US became powerful, and they started to demand a say in local politics. This was aided by the influence of the missionaries. The King gave into these pressures and eventually ended the feudal system and distributed the lands (the Great Mahele). 

King Kamehameha III wanted a sugar reciprocity deal with the US, to equalize the sugar tariffs. The US military was especially interested in Pearl Harbor, but many Hawaiians opposed giving up any land. The last King (Kalakaua) won by a referendum but needed support from American troops after a riot from the losing side. The monarchy had no military. The US granted the sugar Reciprocity Treaty of 1875 in exchange for Pearl Harbor.

*The Bayonet Constitution*
In 1887, a group of foreigners, allied with the planter class and missionaries, started a rebellion. They wanted their own constitution. They had their own militia and forced the King to accept their terms.

The King was succeeded by his sister (Lili'uokalani) who sought to restore the old constitution. She had the support of the people, but her actions were opposed by the cabinet. This led to her own overthrow, by allies of American and European businessmen on the island. They also had the support of the missionaries and sought to annex the island to the US. The US military supported the coup, and the Queen was put under house arrest. The US formerly annexed Hawaii in 1898. Under the guise of supporting American lives and property, the coup plotters got support from US Marines.

The Spanish-American war was underway, and many wanted control over Pearl Harbor to oversee the Pacific and protect the West Coast. In 1897, Japan sent warships to Hawaii to oppose annexation. The threat of Japanese control also pushed the Americans to act. Hawaii had a large Japanese population which the US knew would be sympathetic to Japan. The US-imposed constitution also disenfranchised Asians. 


**About the Book and Observations**

The book is written in a very different style than typical history books. The author dwells on a lot of details almost like a personal diary. It clearly didn’t go through an editor. There’s lots of interesting details, and the culture seems very structured and developed. There are hierarchies and norms. Relationships between men and women are given a lot of attention, much more than what you’d see in a Western history text. In one anecdote, a group lost their food supply during a battle, and so they were forced to eat the root of a plant. This caused diarrhea and so the battle is known as the “Battle of loose bowels”.

I’m another, when a comrade was killed, the group would scrape off the flesh to lower its weight. They would take the bones back for funereal processions.


The pre-Cook days were violent with constant warring between the tribes. When there were wars between blood family members, a genealogist was called to settle the dispute. Wars were brutal and the one in the mid 1700s between Oahu and Maui involved draining the brooks and cutting water supply. Given constant warfare, and the distance between the islands, canoes were extremely valuable.  

Maui and Oahu seemed to be the main seats of power. Molokai is where men were exiled to. I know where “kahuna” comes from now. They were important people in the Hawaiian nobility. 

The connection with nature isn’t just a stereotype. They secure the gills of a shark after its killed. 
When someone dies it’s important to have some part of the body to bury or cremate. Losing the entire body say to a shark, is seen as especially painful. 

Is their use of “tabu” the original usage? Yes, came from Polynesian languages and was introduced to the West by Captain Cook. 

Like native Americans, diseases like small pox and syphilis killed off many Hawaiians 

**Captain Cooks Arrival**

At first the Hawaiians called him Lono, which refers to a god that promised to return. Their test for whether him and his crew were gods was to see if they could be tempted by women (opening their sacred gourde - believe that refers to their scrotums). They did and were hence not gods. The natives were amazed by their guns, pipes (“breathing fire”) and plentiful iron. The explorers brought fleas to the island and introduced prostitution. The women slept with crew members to obtain mirrors and other trinkets. The author himself details how sex was used previously, but maybe this was the first time it became institutionalized. He also blames the prostitution for spreading venereal diseases. As more women went on board the ship to sell themselves for mirrors, it became clear that these were not gods. During a fight, cook was struck by a club and he groaned; this made it clear he wasn’t a god.   

Cook was killed during a fight that was started by natives taking one of the group’s boats. Cook wanted to take a chief hostage until the boat was returned. During the melee, Cook was killed. They used every part of the body, including using his palms as fly swatters. They ate part of his body, possibly because some still thought he was divine. While cook was quickly killed, his legacy lives on in the diseases and prostitution that he left behind. There's a real contrast between how the people perceived Cook - as a god (Lono), versus how the Europeans they treated the native people. They bribed the native women for sex and didn’t hesitate to shoot them. 

After the Cook episode, the islands continue to war on each other. They use the water supply as a weapon and cut it off to weaken the other side. In one battle, dead bodies were burned in ovens and left to dry in the sun. It’s not clear yet what impact Cook had on the different factions. They definitely perceived outside powers as dangerous to their way of life.  


**Island Politics and Unification**

Kama takes over Oahu through brute force. There’s a mix of family politics and intra-clan conflict. But the main goal seems to be purely territorial. The tribes are all vying for control and are mostly related. Kama became convinced that he was destined to rule. There’s some ancient chant that says give yourself to the sea, the land belongs to the sea. In the same way, all conquests come from the sea, as will the foreign ones. In one anecdote where the violence was so intense, the town's water became bitter because of the mix of brain.   

Interestingly, the author is a Christian. He argues that Kama didn’t understand the true god. David sinned and all Israelites paid the price with a place. Someone (maybe him) went to Aaron to offer a sin offering. It was accepted and the disease cured.

Similarly, Kama was told the fires from lava can be extinguished if you offer a sin offering with your own hands. It was important that he do it himself just as Davis had to offer a sacrifice. Kama couldn’t have unified the islands without the decisive power of muskets and cannons, which were obtained from the white men.  

Kama continued to benefit from Westerners on the islands who supported him over other chiefs. The author implies that God willed Kama’s conquest. He points out how brutal war used to be and how civilians were routinely targeted. Yet he also says there are far fewer natives now (in the 1800s) than before, particularly older Hawaiians. I think he’s alluding to fact that westerners brought an end to the senseless wars but other actions may have killed off even more natives.

Once Kama took over the islands (all save for Kuai), he professionalized governance with a finance minister in charge of all expenses and gifts and various advisers with specific expertise. He made it safe for ordinary Hawaiians and took the stigma from poverty away. He was merciful even to those who wronged him in the past, and murder was supposedly very rare under his rule.  

He was very religious and this may be why missionaries never attempted to convert him. He still believed in human sacrifice (I think?). He maintained rule by appointing commoners to lead the different islands (not chiefs or kahunas). The nobility was kept close and he didn’t trust any who amassed personal armies. He also was sure to keep them all happy and fed. It seems most were better off under his rule anyways. 

He definitely benefited from foreign weapons, but their involvement beyond this seems to be minimal. They didn’t take sides, perhaps because there weren’t any resources there. It was a transition from a feudal system to a kingdom. The minor chiefs were fine with small pockets of control given overall violence went down. They could live in peace.

During Kama’s reign they began trading sandalwood with China and received Russian and American ships. The king celebrated the Fourth of July and was gracious towards Americans. On his deathbed he refused human sacrifices. There’s a long explanation of how the bones of the dead were sacred. Families would hide the bones of their dead (especially chiefs) lest the bones be used as weapons which would be an insult to the family.

Kama’s successor ended the various taboos that governed the land. The most controversial was free eating which was men and women eating together. It was still a feudal society though Kama ended some of the most egregious policies which were similar to slavery. The commoners depended on chiefs to proceed them. Especially in those bloody times.  

The author is a religious Christian and criticizes past practices including homosexuality. He reminisces about the days when people were chaste. Hawaiians were known to be hospitable before the missionaries. The islands became depopulated due to disease brought from foreigners and many experts in genealogy were lost. He thanks the US for bringing Christianity and for never trying to annex Hawaii ha. The arrival of missionaries also brought education and literacy. There's a lot of similarities with the missionaries actions in China during the same period.

Drinking and debauchery grew under liholiho’s rule. During his reign, all of the land was held by the chiefs who were also responsible for collecting taxes on the land from commoners. As the king wasn’t responsible for this, he became lazy, drank, and was wasteful. The impact of missionaries continued and during the time of boki, worship of ancient gods was banned. As discussed in [[The Dean of Shandong]], rituals are key to any society. Banning the worship of ancient gods was a major step in destroying the pre-Cook culture and society. 

The lack of a written language and the appeal of learning to read the Bible pushed things in favor of Christianity. There wasn’t much motivation to maintain the ancient practices, especially as taboo ended. The violence of the ruling chiefs and the poverty also likely contributed. New chiefs prohibited ancient gods, distilling rum, chanting, prostitution and others. The role of missionaries is downplayed in the book. How did they break through? Why was it so easy to convert the chiefs?
They were the source for education and modernity perhaps. Evangelical Christianity had a major Impact during this period.

When the queen found out that chiefs were still worshipping bones of the dead, she gathered some from burial sites, burned them, and threw them off cliffs. The end of the eating taboo was considered a Christian act. 

Roman Catholicism had limited appeal as some likened the bowing to images as similar to their pagan religion. The French sent a warship and tried to force the Hawaiian kingdom to allow Catholics to worship freely. These demands were met. Christian ministers began educating chiefs about political economy. The French and British were able to get extra territorial protection for their citizens in Hawaii. The British made Hawaii a protectorate. There were conflicts between the American missionaries who pushed puritan values and British and French officials. Hawaii sought recognition from all of them as an independent kingdom. It was granted and they developed their own constitution which vested power with a legislature. None of the foreign powers (especially the Americans) wanted it to be dominated by others.  

The author laments on how the western style school system didn’t help Hawaiians as many graduates lacked any practical skills. This education system was created largely by the Christian missionaries.

The legislature was filled with foreigners who likely didn’t have the same interests as the native Hawaiians. The land reform of 1849 benefited the native elite (chiefs) and foreigners. Commoners could appeal to get title to the land they worked on, but many didn’t know. Many also preferred to continue living under chiefs. However, chiefs were able to obtain title to their land easily, and many sold it to foreigners who were eager to buy. Many commoners this became landless or slaves to new foreign owners. Before the land reform, land was held by chiefs and inherited. The reform made it possible to sell the land for private development.

  
**The Last King**

Kalakaua was the last king of Hawaii as he beat Queen Emma in an election (the previous leader had no succession plan). Kalakaua was seen to be more Hawaiian than the British loyalist Emma. Even at this time, British and American ships were nearby looking after their interests. When Queen Emma’s supporters contested the election, foreign troops were used to quell the violence.   

Kalakaua was opposed to granting any more rights to Americans and ruled off ceding Pearl Harbor to the Americans. He succeeded in getting a duty exemption for raw Hawaiian sugar exports. The planters in Hawaii needed capital and labour. The poor wages they paid were insufficient to attract local Hawaiians.  

Hawaii was sandwiched between Asia and the US and thus was very strategic. Along with small pox and syphilis, leprosy killed many Hawaiians. Father Damien looked after a leprosy colony on island of Molokai.

The planters continued to push for cheap labour. The King undertook a world tour looking for immigrants. He favored families, but was under pressure to bring workers. The planters controlled land and newspapers and had sway over the government. The king met with the Japanese who were initially reluctant to allow emigration. They were eventually allowed in by the late 1800s, after which the Japanese population swelled. Before that, there were immigrants from China, Portugal, and some from Africa. Most of the native Hawaiians had died from disease.

The reciprocity treaty gave the US docking rights at Pearl Harbor. The planters were trying the abrogate the treaty and push for more rights. The US maintained it to keep the British, French, and Germans at a distance from the Island.  

The king was advised by William Gibson, a Mormon missionary who acquired land in Lanai. The king dreamed of a Pacific empire and attempted an alliance with the Somoans. This effort was opposed by the Germans, British, and Americans. When the Germans threatened war, the effort was abandoned.

Claus Spreckels was a sugar magnate to whom the king and Gibson were indebted. He was the largest creditor to Hawaii. 

**The Bayonet Constitution**

This was forced upon the king by the missionaries and planters. The new constitution took power away from the king and gave it to the legislature and cabinet. The military was also put in the control of the cabinet.

The Hawaiian league was a secret organization of foreign businessmen focused on disempowering the king and (for some members) direct annexation to the US. The Hawaii rifles was a paramilitary organization allied with the league. They were relieved when the king failed with his pacific unification project. They almost lynched Gibson who was blamed for antagonizing the population against non-Hawaiians. The king conceded and Gibson was exiled to San Francisco.

The king retained some veto power. Some Hawaiians tried to restore control to the king failed. The king got sick from alcoholism and sought treatment in the US where he later died.

**The Great Mahele** 
**Hawaiis land division of 1848**
Jon Chinen 

  
This ended the ancient feudal system and broke up King K’s land. In ancient times, land was divided into rational groups and certain people were tasked with remembering the borders and passed them on from generation to generation.

In the feudal system each island was a separate kingdom and the land was wholly owned by the king. He distributed land to his chiefs who in turn distributed it to their followers. At the bottom were the tenants. All had some rights to resources from their land, and although nobles could dispossess the poor from their land this was rarely done. When King K unified the kingdom these practices continued.

This was the case until King K the third who had to deal with a growing number of foreigners who began demanding land titles. They were often backed up by their countries’ warships. K conceded and drafted a constitution and allowed a legislature to come to power. As part of this, he lost absolute control over the land.

The land commission started the process of identifying owners of land. Claimants could make a claim and receive title. You had too know to do this obviously.

The Great Mahele subdivided the land for the king, chiefs, and common people. The King further allotted land to the government for public use, partially to block it from foreign confiscation as he was weary of foreigners on the island. His land was taken when the monarchy was overthrown. Prior to this, the country would periodically sell land to raise funds. As stated elsewhere, many tenants failed to appear before the commission to get their land. Others signed away their land to chiefs, some of whom sold their land to foreigners.
