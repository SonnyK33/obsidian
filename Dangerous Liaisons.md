Dangerous Liaisons details the scheming of two French socialites in pre-revolution France. Vicomte de Valmont and Marquise de Merteuil are former lovers who enjoy toying with the lives of others through sexual mind games. The book is written as a series of letters written between the various characters. Many have argued that the book is a critique of the frivolous lives of the French aristocracy. This makes sense in hindsight given the French Revolution. However when the book was written it was enjoyed by many members of the upper classes, including Marie Antoinette. The book highlights the conservative nature of the Ancien Regime and the power of the church. While the rich could do what they wanted, they were obsessed with what others thought. The repressive nature of the church and society, particularly towards women, was also made clear. I don't know which character angered the public more, but I assume it's Merteuil who, in addition to being uncaring and cruel, is also a kind of feminist. 

I thought the book was interesting particularly because I recently read Camus' Myth of Sisyphus. Camus spent a lot of time on Don Juan and how he qualifed as an absurd man - someone who seeks out new experiences (quantity over quality) and simply does whatever feels good. Valmont clearly fits this mold. Camus talks at length about Don Juan and how seducing many women and not caring about the consequences is embracing the absurdity of life. Tourvel describes him as a libertine with all of its negative connotations. I think he’s different from what Camus describes because he seems to enjoy toying with women rather than looking for a diversity of experiences. He takes himself seriously and seems to have a special malice towards his victims. In fact, while Camus' seems to be praising selfish and cruel behaviour when he endorses the libertine way of life, there is a clear contrast between Don Juan and Valmont. Valmont doesn't do things just for the sake of doing them (the absurd man)  but because he enjoys tormenting his victims.   

Vincent isn’t an absurd man. He pursues women just to ruin them, not for the experience. He sees a lot of meaning in his actions. It’s remarkable how similar social relations were back then to now. Vincent talks about women who pursue men for the prestige for example. Madame rosemomt warns that men pursue actions for their reward, whereas women aim to serve. For women, service itself was the goal. Complains made by one gender about the other were the exact same back then. 

Vincent wonders where Tourvel is hiding the letters as there are no fires that time of the year. He concludes they must be in her pockets and wishes he had the skills of a pickpocket. He says that should be a required skill of a man of intrigue. But that parents don’t think of these things. Although this was funny, it seemed like a serious complaint.   


**Merteuil**
Merteuil talks about how the letter gives away your true feelings, and how it’s easier to deceive with live speech because of the raw emotions. The time it takes to write and send a letter also allows the recipient to gather their feelings and prepare a response. Modern technology obviously changes a lot of this. 

While Vicomte is a libertine who seeks as many experiences as possible, Marteil is cold and calculating. She grew up without friends or the convent, and so learned everything through experience. She learned sex must be enjoyable since it was forbidden by the church. She’s rich and aristocratic and hence not shackled by customs or laws but she’s still rebelling against the conservative culture of the ancien regime.   

Her main goal is to maintain the upper hand in everything. She’s willing to make the wrong decision rather than let her true motivations be known. She has none of Vicomtes sensitivity and was willing to destroy Prevan. While she comes from the conservative nobility, she’s also clearly a feminist and is fighting against male dominated society. I wonder which character elicited more anger from the commoners.

Vincent is least happy when he’s analyzing the actions of Tourvel and searching for meaning. He’s happiest when he ignore all meaning and pursued quantity. Marteil is honest when she tells Cecile that passion is overrated and she should instead focus on the logical. Although she’s been deceitful that’s an accurate depiction of how she operates.

Valmont and Merteuil are jealous of what Cecile and Delaney have. Valmont is in love with madame tourmont and marquis is too afraid of being the victim. They hide these feelings in their games.

Merteuil didn’t remarry because she wanted to be able to deceive for fun not out of necessity. Maybe she's the true absurd "man"? They eventually go to war with each other as they get jealous of each others lovers. Despite them both being libertines of sorts.

**Cecile**
Cecile is extremely naive and has never encountered anyone who wished her harm. A good reason to make sure your kids are exposed to good and bad experiences when they are young. The way she talks about men and love reminds me of the Gabriel Lorca play, House of Bernarda Alba. That play was thought to be an allegory for the conservatism of the Catholic Church in fascist Spain. Cecile just came from a convent and shows the same kinda of repressed feelings as Alba's daughters.
  
**Volanges**
Madame Volanges talks about the importance of others’ opinions and how you have no right to complain if you lose the public trust. Hell is other people.   

**Presidente**
Presidente is hyper rational and doesn’t believe that potential love should override reason.


The most striking thing to me is how modern the story seems. The very last letter from Cecile’s mother is a warning to parents to watch their kids. Sons and daughters. 

It’s also very much a morality story. At the end, Merteuil gets small pox, is disfigured, and loses the court case.
