2023 Election
[[Median Voter Theory]]
This will be the most competitive election in a long time in Turkey. The February earthquake may give Erdogan a chance to enact looser fiscal policies. It will also reignite conflicts with Syria and between Syrian refugees seeking aid and Turks. Different groups have started fighting over government aid. 

June Currency Crisis
[[Turkey's Increasing Balance Sheet Risks]]
The crisis appears similar to Mexico's "Tequila" crisis of 1994, as described in [[Volatility Machine]].
In an effort to show credibility, the central bank has guaranteed the exchange rate of 120bn of TRY deposits. They've also borrowed $130bn in FX from domestic banks. The country will have to stop defending the currency and put limits on dollar deposit withdrawals.
