GS Currie note - 12.14.22

-   Large amounts of capex that wouldâ€™ve gone to Europe will now come to the US given potential caps on NG prices in Europe and incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act
- The EU is angry with US subsidies to green tech companies and likely to offer their own
- not clear if subsidies will be sufficent to make up for the damage being done by the caps on gas prices
	- will likely shut down a large amount of German industrial capacity (see Currie's note)
