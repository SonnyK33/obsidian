Telecom industry:
From Rakuten's roadshow on 11.15.23:

It's currently hard to switch mobile operators. You have to go to your provider first and then cancel. This will change next year. You'll be able to go to the new provider (eg rakuten), and they'll make all of the changes.  These are part of broader changes to mobile regulations in Japan . Unlike other developed countries, there's no open auction system for spectrum. You have to be invited by the country/regulator to buy spectrum.

What's the history of Japan's closed spectrum system? Tied to the power of the old conglomerates?
