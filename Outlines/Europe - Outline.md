**Natural Gas**
GS - note (Natural Gas: A lower TTF cap means a higher risk of market disruption) - 12.20.22
- a lower price cap increases the risk of market disruption and will lead to more destruction of industrial capacity

**Chips**
[[Chip war]]

**Fiscal Spending**
Caps on natural gas prices plus the push for more advanced chip manufacturing in Germany mean more fiscal spending. That, in addition with quantitative tightening, means much higher Eurozone yields.

**Germany**
Germany is under pressure from the US, UK, and others to supply Ukraine with tanks. A majority of German people are against getting involved in the war due to the memory of germanys militaristic past and ties with Russia. Germany has authority over sending its own tanks and over the re-export of German made tanks used by 13 other countries including Poland.


**Italy**

**France**
Macron is trying to raise the retirement age due to shifting demographics (less working people). Pensions use up a larger portion of GDP than the EU average.

**Tech**
EU member states are starting to develop regulations on tech firms ahead of Brussels - notably Germany. German laws are giving more power to regulators than the EU ones and are allowing pre-emptive actions.

**Russia**
[[Russia - outline]]
The EU is set to cut Russian diesel which makes up 25pct of their needs. Russia could try selling it to India or China, but they have their own refining capacity so may be reluctant to import it. As a result market will get tighter.
