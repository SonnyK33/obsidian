**Brazil**
Lula presides over a very divided country. Sizable minorities were in favour of the attempted coup. The military is filled with Bolsonaro supporters and so Lula needs to tread carefully. Many in the far right don’t trust Lula and believe he shouldn’t have been able to run again. In the background are left wing governments newly elected throughout Latin America. In the US the focus is on the connection with Trump and Jan 6, but this is part of a struggle in Latin America between the elite and the poor that’s been going on for a long time.
