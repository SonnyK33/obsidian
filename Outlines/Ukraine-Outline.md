**Relations with Hungary**
Most assume Hungaryâ€™s position in Russia/Ukraine war is all about Orban wanting to remain close to Putin and its reliance on gas imports. But there are deeper issues as well. Ukraine has banned all minority language education. While this supposedly targeted Russian speakers it also shut down 100 schools for ethnic Hungarians, angering Hungary. As the war goes on, the the country's far-right will be strengthened. This will further alienate Hungary and likely other groups. This is one of the many issues which could tear the EU apart.
