- Since the end of Bretton Woods in 2971, gold spiked in the 1970s and 2000s
	- both driven by declines in production
- production has been falling since 2019, and looks interesting with structural inflation and various central banks (espcially China) switching to gold from UST 
- many gold miners have shifted production to rare minerals needed for battery production as part of an ESG push
- even Newmont is producing the same amount of Au they did 16 years ago, w/ smaller reserves
- miners tend to engage in M&A at the peak of the cycle
- they currently have record cash balances and have delevered over the past 7 years (very little net-issuance)
- like E&P's, capex has been declining as well 
- also like E&Ps, miners are a small part of equity index
- silver relative to M2, is near an all-time low 
- When the % of yield curve inversions > 70%, that's a good indicator for recessions and when to be long gold and short the S&P
	- since the 1970s, it's happened 7 times, and equally invested on both sides gave 70% returns over the next 2 years
- current environment most silmilar to period before 1970s staglation and 2000 tech bubble burst
	- long gold vs short S&P yielded 150% over the next 2 years
