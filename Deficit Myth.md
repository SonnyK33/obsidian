**Executive Summary**
Inflation is the only constraint on fiscal spending, and a "sovereign issuer", that is a country who borrows in its own currency has no fiscal constraints. This is equivalent to saying that  that real resources are a country's only constraint. They can print as much currency as they want; what matters is if there are enough assets to purchase. Conventional wisdom say that a country needs to keep its fiscal house in order just like a household or a business. They argue that expenses must be financed either with taxes or borrowing. Kelton argues that both of those mechanisms serve other purposes, as there is no need to finance spending. Taxes jumpstart and incentivize an economy. What gives value to a nation's currency? You only want it because others want it. This becomes a circular reference. An argument that makes sense to me is that you want it because you are required to pay taxes to the government in its own currency. If this wasn't a requirement, you may choose to transact in other currencies. This theory is called chartalism, which was a precursor to MMT. Countries borrow in order to give their residents (and foreigners) a savings product. Kelton compares treasuries and dollars to savings and chequing accounts, respectively. It's clear that there is a desire for treasury securities amongst the American public. That itself gives a reason for the US to borrow. The implications of Kelton's argument (which is a summary of Modern Monetary Theory) is that governments can and should spend more money on causes deemed worthy. They shouldn't feel restrained for ideological reasons. I agree with the theoretical underpinnings of her argument. The tough part is implementation. She proposes for an agency similar to the CBO to rule on budgets and decide whether they are likely to increase the capacity for the economy to absorb future spending. That is, for them to decide when spending will be inflationary or not. I'm not an expert here, but I suspect that would be a difficult exercise filled with many assumptions. That doesn't mean it shouldn't be attempted though.   

Taxes are for reducing inequality and to create demand for currency. The state does this to incentivize work and the creation of public goods. Chartalism was a theory that the ancient world used taxes to organize society. MMT argues that it, rather than barter system, was common in history. Dollars then became the medium of exchange, but that was not the original purpose. 

Turning around the standard order of operations, MMT argues that taxes need to be earned before they can be spent. That is, every dollar that people pay in taxes had to come from fiscal spending originally. There are four purposes of taxes: demand for currency, stem inflation, reduce inequality, and deter certain behaviors.   

Role of borrowing
Treasuries are just interest bearing dollars. The government chooses to issue interest bearing dollars (yellow dollars) equal to the deficit, it doesn’t need to borrow to finance deficits - it could also issue non-interest bearing dollars if it wanted to   

Chapter 2
There are two types of inflation: cost push, which refers to acts of god, union pressure, etc. and demand pull, which refers to situations where there is more demand than supply. If the economy is at full employment, more fiscal can increase price level and is inflationary  

Monetarist definition 
They believed excess money supply creates inflation. Keynes argues in favor of spending to boost wages and employment. Friedman came up with the natural rate; if the economy goes below that, prices will rise more than wages, and employees will demand higher wages. This will cause unemployment to return to its natural level. His key argument was that a certain amount of unemployed people were necessary to stabilize inflation.

The Fed optimizes inflation with unemployment. NAIRU is obviously unobservable, but the Fed implicitly allows certain unemployment to achieve price stability. MMT argues Fed is ill-equipped for crises as its only tools create more private sector debt (by encouraging borrowing). There are some parallels here with [[Trade Wars are Class Wars]], which argues that the federal government should borrow more to alleviate debt burdens on households. 

  

Downplays issue of skill mismatch in unemployment. How to address?

  

Lerner argued for functional finance - use fiscal policies to close output gap. Tax and spending to achieve balance. Raise taxes and cut fiscal if inflation.

Would still have involuntary unemployment

MMT argues for a federal job guarantee

Federal job guarantee

Guarantee anyone who wants a job one in the caring sector 

Would set a min wage which becomes the floor, say $15/hr

Would act as an automatic stabilizer

Will know if at full employment if no one shows up for federal job 

Analogous to risk free rate that savers can access

Would smoothen cycles and keep skills fresh

Would replace some unemployment schemes  

Decentralize nature of jobs to local level but financing guaranteed be federal government 

Would help people who have big gaps in employment 

Could use rate to set price of labour as we currently set price of capital 

Could actually ease labour inflation - as there would ideally be a pool of employable people available and you wouldn’t have to bid up employed people 

  

Taxes on the rich don’t open up fiscal space as the rich were unlikely to spend anyways

So if economy is at capacity and you decide to raise fiscal spending and pay with tax on rich, will

Be inflationary 

  

CBO should analyze inflation risk rather than effect on deficit 

  

Chapter 3

People hate the federa debt but like treasury securities

Trade surplus means creditor country has insufficient domestic demand

They’re paid in dollars which they choose to convert to treasuries - analogous to moving from checking to savings account 

  

Stab - spend 100, tax 90 leaves 10 left 

They then borrow an equivalent 10

But the credit gets the 10 from the government

  

No budget limit 

Limit is the economy’s ability to absorb extra spending

More

Borrowing means more interest at higher rates possibly which means more money in the economy which can be inflationary

Lot of treasuries held by foreigners so inflationary impact could be muted

  

MMT argument is to keep rates low bc prevents rate exceeding gdp growth and prevents unsustainable debt dynamics 

  

Central banks drive short term rates and can control LT by buying bonds as fed did during ww2 or Japan doing now through YCC

  

Monetizing debt would not change the private sectors wealth

Would hold dollars Vs treasuries

Only thing would change is no interest income

So should

Push prices down

  

Every time debt was paid off through surpluses economy went into recession

Clinton came close to paying off debt in late 90s but stopped as worried about no treasuries and the ability of Fed to set rates 

At the time treasuries used to drain reserves and set rates 

That’s now done directly so not needed for this purpose 

Main purpose now is for a safe interest earning asset

  

Chapter 4

Mainstream argues that fiscal deficits crowd out private savings and investment by raising rates

Furman argued this - why?

Godley - one equation of the world 

Sector balance models

  

Gov balance = non government balance 

SFC models - all flows must sum to a stock somewhere

Accumulated fiscal deficits should equal our savings

And so doesn’t decrease savings 

  

Crowding out argument is that borrowings to finance deficits take up scarce savings and so increase rates for investment financing 

This is the loanable funds model

But even here the deficits should turn into treasuries held by the public (since they finance deficits w borrowing) which are financial assets and should increase available funding for investment 

  

Only reason govt issues bonds when deficits is to clean up reserves and keep the rate in check 

Prevents infusion of reserves from pushing rate below target level

  

Treasuries issuers through auctions to primary dealers who are backstopped by fed. Fed makes sure that it’s profitable to purchase.

Without bond sales to finance deficits

High deficits should push rates down as would lead to excess reserves 

To avoid that, pre 2008, the Fed would perform open market operations and sell treasuries to drain reserves

Now they just set the rate 

  

Primary dealers are in special position and guaranteed to profit so will always set reasonable bids 

Not really a fair market

Until 1951 the Fed would stand ready to buy unlimited Tbills at a set rate which gave banks an alternative to reserves 

Fed was able to set rates at 0 in 08 despite 10pct deficit 

  

If borrowing in FX, crowding out is real risk

If fixed exchange rate regime lose control of rate

Eg when Russia fixed rate to usd in 1998, ppl demanded dollars which drive up rates 

Couldn’t keep low rates as needed to disincentivize conversion given limited reserves

Explains high rates in countries w default risk and fixed exchange rates

If fiscal deficit is less than trade deficit implies a private sector deficit

See charts in attachment

Can improve private sector balance by increasing fiscal deficit over trade deficit or by cutting trade deficit

If can’t devalue currency like eurozone many use inter devaluations ie cutting labour costs like Germany w Hartz reforms in early 2000s

  

Job guarantee will alleviate fears from job losses due to trade deficits

  

Obsession w trade deficit remnant from gold standard when you needed it to buy imports and deficits cost gold

Abandoned during ww1 then reestablisjed post ww2

But tied to usd 

Nixon then abandoned to get more policy space

Nixon cut taxes price controls and ended convertibility

Gold standard Was under pressure from Uk devaluations and others but Nixon fully ended it

Developing countries that issue in own currency still aren’t completely monetarily sovereign as need to worry about imports which require hard currency

Developing countries w import needs further erode sovereignty by borrowing in dollars

  

Pegging, dollarizing or currency unions weaken monetary sovereignty 

The first 2 also encourage the private sector to borrow in dollars and the sovereign may accumulate more dollar debt

All weakening sovereignty 

  

Countries w deep capital markets that can attract investment creates a bid for their currencies as well 

This gives them more policy space

  

Developing countries tend to import high value goods and export cheap labour and commodities

Investors speculate but don’t make real investments in local currency 

Having to buy fx for imports further weakens currency making it harder to service foreign debts

These countries vulnerable to carry crashes as they get speculative capital that leaves quickly 

  

Volcker hikes causes bankruptcies throughout EM as whole world exposed to US rates and fx

WB and IMF created during bretton woods when exchange rates were fixed

They remained after and are fixated on free trade and capital flows 

Thought those would discipline developing economies

Advise countries to raise rates, cut fiscal, open trade and sometimes to peg currency

Countries that try pegs but can’t get enough fx may have to abandon pegs causing rapid depreciation and possible hyperinflation as costs are passed through 

  

WB frequently tells these countries to specialize their exports and focus on comparative advantage rather than develop the way rich countries developed

China and the US limited imports during their development stage and focused on domestic production

China also limited role of financials institutions 

  

Argentina instituted job guarantee after defaulting in 2000 - check this 

  

Most free trade acts force developing countries to focus on export led growth and to internally devalue through lower wages and regulations

  

Developing countries should regulate capital flows even if can’t get to level of bretton woods

Make it harder for speculators to put in hot money and easily pull out 

  

Chapter 6

Was mistake to tie social security to payroll taxes as not necessary to fund

Medicare parts B and D are funded through SMI trust 

That one is deemed sustainable only bc Fed govt is authorized to pay benefits whether the trust is funded or not

  

Life expectancy is skewed and hasn’t increased for the poor

There should be focus on developing productive capacity to handle govt benefits eg doctors for Medicare patients

Greenspan when testifying and answering Paul Ryan’s question- no issue of solvency for entitlement program 

Question is if economy will produce enough assets for program beneficiaries to consume

Enough healthcare, consumption goods etc

For Medicare the question isn’t how to pay for it but how to resource it

Need enough doctors and hospitals

Need to invest in education and other productive capacity

Income inequality leads to savings deficit per pettis as well

MMT is about fiscal space

If there are unemployed ppl and there’s an ability to produce more goods without raising prices should do that 

  

Promotes fiscal over monetary in importance

No new powers - congress already has completely discretion since abandoning the gold standard 

CBO already scores on fiscal could do same on real resources 

  

Shelf project - run by a Georgetown professor - has a shelf full of proposals for raising tax revenue to satisfy paygo requirements 

  

If moving to more fiscal

Need guardrails but also automatic fiscal stabilizers that don’t require congressional action

Eg the job guarantee

A job in country’s unit of account is essentially a tax credit

Jobs for guarantee to be determined at community level

Focused on unmet needs 

expecting 15m ppl on it on average 

Tried in Argentina and India but shouldn’t be temporary but a permanent shock absorber 

Would need a stock of necessary jobs on hand to b filled 

  

Tobin explained to jfk that inflation is only cap on fiscal Spending
