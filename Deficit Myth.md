**Questions**
1) Kelton downplays the importance of skill mis-matches in unemployment
2) Furman argued fiscal deficit crowd out private investment - why?


Takeaways
1) The only reason the government issues bonds when there are deficits, is to clean up reserves and keep the rate in check. That's because fiscal deficits flow into bank accounts and increase the reserves in the system. Excess reserves push interest rates down. This makes intuitive sense. If the government spends excess money into the system, banks can keep deposit rates low as they won't be craving liquidity. So the government borrowing actually serves to prevent the infusion of excess reserves which would push rates below the target level.
2) If borrowing in FX, crowding out is a real risk. If there's a fixed exchange rate regime, you lose control of the interest rate. For example, when Russia fixed its rate to the USD in 1998, people demanded dollars which drove up rates. They couldn’t keep low rates as they needed to disincentivize conversion, given limited FX reserves. This explains high rates in countries with default risk and fixed exchange rates.
3) There should be a focus on developing productive capacity to handle govt benefits e.g. doctors for Medicare patients rather than funding the program.




**Executive Summary**
Inflation is the only constraint on fiscal spending, and a "sovereign issuer", that is a country who borrows in its own currency has no fiscal constraints. This is equivalent to saying that  that real resources are a country's only constraint. They can print as much currency as they want; what matters is if there are enough assets to purchase. Conventional wisdom says that a country needs to keep its fiscal house in order just like a household or a business. They argue that expenses must be financed either with taxes or borrowing. Kelton argues that both of those mechanisms serve other purposes, as there is no need to finance spending. Taxes jumpstart and incentivize an economy. What gives value to a nation's currency? You only want it because others want it. This becomes a circular reference. An argument that makes sense to me is that you want it because you are required to pay taxes to the government in its own currency. If this wasn't a requirement, you may choose to transact in other currencies. This theory is called chartalism, which was a precursor to MMT. Countries borrow in order to give their residents (and foreigners) a savings product. Kelton compares treasuries and dollars to savings and chequing accounts, respectively. It's clear that there is a desire for treasury securities amongst the American public. That itself gives a reason for the US to borrow. The implications of Kelton's argument (which is a summary of Modern Monetary Theory) is that governments can and should spend more money on causes deemed worthy. They shouldn't feel restrained for ideological reasons. I agree with the theoretical underpinnings of her argument. The tough part is implementation. She proposes for an agency similar to the CBO to rule on budgets and decide whether they are likely to increase the capacity for the economy to absorb future spending. That is, for them to decide when spending will be inflationary or not. I'm not an expert here, but I suspect that would be a difficult exercise filled with many assumptions. That doesn't mean it shouldn't be attempted though. She also proposes a job guarantee as an automatic stabilizer that would also set the minimum price of labour like the Fed currently sets the minimum cost of capital.



**Summary**

Taxes are for reducing inequality and to create demand for currency. The state does this to incentivize work and the creation of public goods. Chartalism was a theory that the ancient world used taxes to organize society. MMT argues that it, rather than barter system, was common in history. Dollars then became the medium of exchange, but that was not the original purpose. 

Turning around the standard order of operations, MMT argues that taxes need to be earned before they can be spent. That is, every dollar that people pay in taxes had to come from fiscal spending originally. There are four purposes of taxes: demand for currency, stem inflation, reduce inequality, and deter certain behaviors.   

Role of borrowing
Treasuries are just interest bearing dollars. The government chooses to issue interest bearing dollars (yellow dollars) equal to the deficit, it doesn’t need to borrow to finance deficits - it could also issue non-interest bearing dollars if it wanted to   

Chapter 2
There are two types of inflation: cost push, which refers to acts of god, union pressure, etc. and demand pull, which refers to situations where there is more demand than supply. If the economy is at full employment, more fiscal can increase price level and is inflationary  

Monetarist definition 
They believed excess money supply creates inflation. Keynes argues in favor of spending to boost wages and employment. Friedman came up with the natural rate; if the economy goes below that, prices will rise more than wages, and employees will demand higher wages. This will cause unemployment to return to its natural level. His key argument was that a certain amount of unemployed people were necessary to stabilize inflation.

The Fed optimizes inflation with unemployment. NAIRU is obviously unobservable, but the Fed implicitly allows certain unemployment to achieve price stability. Kelton downplays the issue of skill mismatch in unemployment, but this is a real issue. MMT argues Fed is ill-equipped for crises as its only tools create more private sector debt (by encouraging borrowing). There are some parallels here with [[Trade Wars are Class Wars]], which argues that the federal government should borrow more to alleviate debt burdens on households.   

Lerner argued for functional finance-- the use of fiscal policies to close the output gap. Tax and spending are used to achieve a balance. The government can raise taxes and cut fiscal spending if there's inflation, and vice versa. However, there would still be involuntary unemployment. MMT hence argues for a federal job guarantee.

**Federal Job Guarantee**

The government would guarantee anyone who wants a job one in the caring sector. It would set a minimum wage which becomes the floor, say $15/hr. This would act as an automatic stabilizer. We would know if the economy is truly at full employment if no one shows up for federal job. It's analogous to the risk free rate that savers can access. It would smoothen cycles and keep skills fresh and would replace some unemployment schemes. The program should decentralize the granting of jobs to the local level, but the financing would be guaranteed by the federal government. This would help people who have big gaps in employment and would set minimum price of labour as we currently set price of capital. It could actually ease labour inflation, as there would ideally be a pool of employable people available and you wouldn’t have to bid up employed people.  

**Taxes**
Taxes on the rich don’t open up fiscal space as the rich were unlikely to spend anyways. 
So if economy is at capacity and you decide to raise fiscal spending and pay with tax on rich, that will be inflationary. The CBO should analyze inflation risk rather than the effect on the deficit. 

  

Chapter 3 - Debt

People hate the federal debt, but they like treasury securities. A trade surplus means a creditor country has insufficient domestic demand. Exporters are paid in dollars which they choose to convert to treasuries; this is analogous to moving from checking to savings accounts. There isn't a budget limit but there is a limit on the economy’s ability to absorb extra spending. More borrowing means more interest at higher rates possibly which means more money in the economy which can be inflationary. Lot of treasuries are now held by foreigners so the inflationary impact could be muted. The MMT argument is to keep rates low and below the GDP growth rate to prevent unsustainable debt dynamics. Central banks drive short term rates and can control long-term rates by buying bonds, as the Fed did during WW2 or Japan is doing now through YCC.   

If the Fed was to monetize debt, it would not change the private sector's wealth. They would simply hold dollars rather than treasuries. The only thing that would change is no interest income would be earned. So that may actually push prices down.   

Every time the debt was paid off through surpluses, the economy went into recession. Clinton came close to paying off the debt in late 1990s, but he stopped as the government worried about the lack of treasuries and the ability of the Fed to set rates. At the time, treasuries were used to drain reserves and set rates. That’s now done directly, so they are not needed for this purpose. The main purpose now is for a safe interest earning asset.  

Chapter 4

The mainstream argues that fiscal deficits crowd out private savings and investment by raising rates. Godley's "one equation of the world" used sector balance models.  

Gov balance = non government balance 
SFC models require that all flows must sum to a stock somewhere.
Accumulated fiscal deficits should equal our savings, and so they don't decrease savings.  

The crowding out argument is that borrowings to finance deficits take up scarce savings, and so it increases rates for investment financing. This is the loanable funds model. But even in this formulation,  the deficits should turn into treasuries held by the public (since they finance deficits with borrowing) which are financial assets and should increase available funding for investment.  

The only reason the government issues bonds when there are deficits, is to clean up reserves and keep the rate in check. That's because fiscal deficits flow into bank accounts and increase the reserves in the system. Excess reserves push interest rates down. This makes intuitive sense. If the government spends excess money into the system, banks can keep deposit rates low as they won't be craving liquidity. So the government borrowing actually serves to prevent the infusion of excess reserves which would push rates below the target level. To avoid excess reserves, pre-2008, the Fed would perform open market operations and sell treasuries to drain reserves. Now they just set the rate. 

Treasuries are issued through auctions to primary dealers who are backstopped by fed. The Fed makes sure that it’s profitable for the participating banks to purchase. Primary dealers are in special position and guaranteed to profit so will always set reasonable bids. Until 1951, the Fed would stand ready to buy unlimited treasury bills at a set rate which gave banks an alternative to reserves. The Fed was able to set rates at 0% in 2008 despite a 10% deficit. This only applies to borrowing in your currency.  

If borrowing in FX, crowding out is a real risk. If there's a fixed exchange rate regime, you lose control of the interest rate. For example, when Russia fixed its rate to the USD in 1998, people demanded dollars which drove up rates. They couldn’t keep low rates as they needed to disincentivize conversion, given limited FX reserves. This explains high rates in countries with default risk and fixed exchange rates.

If the fiscal deficit is less than trade deficit, that implies a private sector deficit. 

M - X = (I - S) - (T - G)
(M-X) + (T-G) = I-S
(M-X) - (G-T) = I-S
(G-T) - (M-X) = S-I
S-I<0 <=> (M-X) > (G-T)
 
Private Sector balance = fiscal deficit - trade deficit


It's possible to improve the private sector balance by increasing the fiscal deficit over the trade deficit or by cutting trade deficit. Countries try to cut their trade deficit by devaluing their currency. If they can’t devalue (because they're in a currency union for example), many will internally devalue i.e. by cutting labour costs like Germany did with the Hartz reforms in the early 2000s. Trade deficits aren't necessarily bad, but they do imply job losses in export-led sectors. The job guarantee would alleviate these fears.  

The obsession with the trade deficit is a remnant from the gold standard when you needed it to buy imports and deficits led to gold outflows. This was abandoned during WW1, and was then reestablished post WW2. The gold standard was tied to the US dollar and was part of a fixed exchange rate framework. Nixon abandoned the standard to get more policy space. He cut taxes, implemented price controls, and ended convertibility. The gold standard was already under pressure from UK devaluations and others, but Nixon fully ended it.

Developing countries that issue in their own currency still aren’t completely monetarily sovereign as need to worry about imports which require hard currency. Developing countries with import needs further erode their sovereignty by borrowing in dollars. Pegging, dollarizing, or currency unions weaken monetary sovereignty. The first two also encourage the private sector to borrow in dollars, leading the sovereign to also accumulate more dollar debt. All of these moves weaken sovereignty.  

Countries with deep capital markets that can attract investment create a bid for their currencies as well, which gives them more policy space. Developing countries tend to import high value goods and export cheap labour and commodities. Investors speculate but don’t make real investments in local currency. Having to buy FX for imports, further weakens their currency making it harder to service foreign debts. These countries vulnerable to carry crashes as they get speculative capital that leaves quickly [[The Rise of Carry]].   

The Volcker hikes caused bankruptcies throughout EM as the whole world was exposed to US rates and FX. The WB and IMF were created during Bretton Woods when exchange rates were fixed. They remained after and are fixated on free trade and capital flows. Those policies are said to discipline developing economies. They advise countries to raise rates, cut fiscal, open trade and sometimes to peg currency. Countries that try pegs but can’t get enough FX may have to abandon the pegs, causing rapid depreciation and possible hyperinflation, as costs are passed through. The World Bank frequently tells these countries to specialize their exports and focus on their comparative advantage rather than develop the same way rich countries developed. China and the US limited imports during their development stage and focused on domestic production. China also limited the role of financial institutions. 

 Most free trade acts force developing countries to focus on export led growth and to internally devalue through lower wages and regulations. Developing countries should regulate capital flows even if they can’t get to the level of Bretton Woods. That would make it harder for speculators to put in hot money and easily pull out.   

Chapter 6

It was mistake to tie social security to payroll taxes as they aren't necessary to fund the program. Medicare parts B and D are funded through SMI trust. That one is deemed sustainable only because the federal government is authorized to pay benefits whether the trust is funded or not. Life expectancy is skewed and hasn’t increased for the poor. There should be a focus on developing productive capacity to handle govt benefits e.g. doctors for Medicare patients rather than funding the program.

Greenspan, when testifying and answering Paul Ryan’s question, said there was no issue of solvency for any entitlement program. The question is if the economy will produce enough assets for program beneficiaries to consume (e.g. enough healthcare, consumption goods etc.). For Medicare, the question isn’t how to pay for it, but how to resource it. There is a need to invest in education and other productive capacity. Income inequality leads to savings deficits (per Pettis as well - [[Trade Wars are Class Wars]]). MMT is about generating fiscal space. If there are unemployed people, and there’s an ability to produce more goods without raising prices, we should do that. It promotes fiscal over monetary in importance. It doesn't require any new powers. Congress already has completely discretion since abandoning the gold standard. The CBO already scores on fiscal could do same on real resources.  

The Shelf project, run by a Georgetown professor, has a shelf full of proposals for raising tax revenue to satisfy pay-go requirements. 

If moving to a system more reliant on fiscal policy, there needs to be guardrails but also automatic fiscal stabilizers that don’t require congressional action, e.g. the job guarantee. A job in country’s unit of account is essentially a tax credit (i.e. a way to pay taxes that are required to be paid in a certain currency). Jobs would be be determined at the community level and would focused on unmet needs. They expect an average of 15m people on it at any given time. 

Argentina instituted a job guarantee after defaulting in 2000 [[Argentina - Outline]]. It was also tried in India, but it shouldn’t be temporary but a permanent shock absorber.
