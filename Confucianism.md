Like Daoism, this emerged during the warring states period. Confuscious was born to a teenage mother and an old father. He was raised as a commoner, though his father was a famous warrior. He was interested in history from a young age and was on quest to save China from violence during the warring period.  

He tried to embody Chinese culture in philosophy, which is partially why he's so popular. His cryptic writing also left open many interpretations which suited different people. Most of his followers were commoners. Like Socrates, he focused on the importance of morality. Leaders must set a good example and instill the importance of morality. People should do so not out of fear from the state or god (as Socrates would argue) but because they want to. 

This was novel during the warring states period. He said there were 6 qualities to being virtuous, and that you should be moral for its own sake. He eventually obtained a minister position where he imposed strict traditions and rules. This worked to lower crime. The Han dynasty was based on his philosophy, and it remained the dominant school of thought until the communist revolution.
