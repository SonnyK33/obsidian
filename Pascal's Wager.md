We use critical reasoning and smart bets throughout our lives so why not for god. You have little to lose and infinite to gain by believing in god. This was in response to the agnostics who asked why a god would require faith over reasoned belief.   

There were many counter arguments. Even if you buy the logic, how do you force belief in someone? The sSame logic could be used to believe in Santa for example. You have nothing to lose from believing in all sorts of things. Also, what if you’re praying to the wrong god?

Believers would argue what are you giving up? A hedonistic life? But there are alternatives. There are obviously alternatives between Christianity and hedonism. Agnostics would ask why would this just god require your belief? But that doesn’t address Pascal's argument.

His dad homeschooled him. He told him what the subjects are about but forbade him from doing actual work including math until the time was right. That made him want to learn more. He believes scientific truth was impossible because we’re always learning new things.
We should always keep pushing to learn more.
