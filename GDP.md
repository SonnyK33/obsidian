Investment = physical investments not financial

Fundamental identity:
With no government - 

national income = national product
NI = Savings  + Consumption; S = NI - C
NP = Investment + Consumption
Since NI = NP,
S + C = I + C or
S = I

Including government - 

NP = I + C + G
where G = government purchase of goods and services

Private Savings = Disposable Income - Consumption
= NI - taxes - C

Gov't Savings = taxes - G

Savings = Private Savings + Gov't Savings
S = NI - taxes -C + taxes - G
= NI -C - G

since NP = NI

= NP - C - G
= I +C +G - C - G
so S = I

Including government and foreign markets -

GDP = C + I(private) + G + (X-M)
imports are negated to prevent double counting consumption and investment of goods that were produced abroad

This means the sum of all income is that which is produced from consumption, private investment, government goods and services, and exports

GDP - C - I - G = X-M
(GDP - C - G) - I = X-M

The difference between national income and private and government consumption is savings:
S - I = X-M 
This is ignoring income from abroad (also implies GDP = GNP).
So savings gap is equal to the trade balance and approximately the current account. 

Income can also only be used for a few purposes - consumption, private savings, taxes, or sent abroad:
GDP = C + S(private) + taxes + Tr
C + I(private) + G + (X-M) = C + S(private) + taxes + tr
X-M-tr = (S-I) + (taxes - G)
and  X-M-tr is the current account

So current account equals excess savings plus budget surpluses. If there are excess total savings, these get invested abroad giving a capital account deficit and current account surplus. 
If there are negative excess savings, that leads to a current account deficit. The dissavings must be financed by capital flows (capital account surplus). This means that FX is used to acquire your financial assets and not your exports. Hence, this leads to a current account deficit.
