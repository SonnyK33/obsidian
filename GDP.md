Investment = physical investments not financial

Fundamental identity:
With no government - 

national income = national product
NI = Savings  + Consumption; S = NI - C
NP = Investment + Consumption
Since NI = NP,
S + C = I + C or
S = I

Including government - 
NP = I + C + G
where G = government purchase of goods and services

Private Savings = Disposable Income - Consumption
= NI - taxes - C

Gov't Savings = taxes - G

Savings = Private Savings + Gov't Savings
S = NI - taxes -C + taxes - G
= NI -C - G

since NP = NI

= NP - C - G
= I +C +G - C - G
so S = I
