Some argue that stoicism is the opposite of epicureanism. It's all about self sacrifice for a cause and not being beaten down by adversity. Epicureanism is easy going and free from superstition. It's similarly not bothered by day to day social issues. These are two sides of the same coin actually, as both schools gives ways to stay tranquil during a crisis.

Epicureans say you should focus on what matters and not get stressed about what you can’t control (i.e. what won't cause you pain if not addressed). Stoics say you should focus on your principles and character. It's much more selfless than epicureanism. Stoics use reason to handle adversity and to fit into harmony of the world. Our troubles are insignificant in the broader sense. 

This ability to reason sets humans apart from animals. We have opinions based on things other than instinct. Logic, rhetoric, and grammar are key parts of stoicism. Dialectics and discussing topics are key to knowledge and understanding. You must be able to reason and to refute bad arguments.

A wise man is a dialectician; that is someone who gains knowledge through discourse. 
Dialectics distinguish truth from falsehoods. It clarifies plausible and ambiguous statements by answering questions methodically. If you're not trained in this methodology, it's easy to become careless. Knowledge means you can’t be dissuaded by an argument because you've fully reasoned through it. 

One hand in a fist, enclosed in the other symbolizes the perfect true knowledge which is the interconnection of firmly-grasped principles.
