Odd Lots podcast with Setser


One fundamental result from this book was that a country's internal balance (savings vs investment) must equal its external balance (trade balance). The former is a function of domestic politics and history. Any changes to a country's trade balance must be examined  for their affect on the internal balance as well. 

Adam Tooze (Chartbook 7/9/23) had a chart showing unit labour costs have converged with the US. But if  consumption as a percentage of national income is still much lower than the US, doesn’t that imply GDP per person is much higher in China ?

Setser, on Odd Lots podcast, says most Chinese debt is held at cities and with LGVs. The central government has little debt, but it has the most revenue raising abilities. States sold land to raise revenue which they can’t do anymore due to the crash in property prices. If the crisis continues, the federal government may have to assume the debt of states and cities.
