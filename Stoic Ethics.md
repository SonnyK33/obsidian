There were three main schools of stoic thought - Seneca, Aurelius, and Epictetus.  
They each dealt with adversity in their own way. Seneca had to advise Nero. Aurelius was emperor of Rome, and Epictetus was a cripple. 

Stoicism says to divide everything into what you can and can’t control. The former is your thoughts and actions, and is where you should focus. This has many similarities to Buddhism. Nothing is good or bad; things just happen, mostly out of your control.  Focus on reacting rationally and without emotion. You can practice this by expecting bad things to happen everyday. You don’t need low expectations, but you should accept your fate. People see anger as an involuntary reaction, but that’s false. It’s actually a form of desire, for revenge for example and is under our control. We are all directed by fate, and we must accept that. 

When you lose someone or something, they aren’t lost, but given back to nature. We’re all part of one big machine and we must focus on our own unique thread. Don’t concern yourself with jealousies of others, but rather focus on your own job and role in the world. There are a lot of links with Buddhism.
