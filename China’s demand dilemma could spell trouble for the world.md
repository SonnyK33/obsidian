[[Trade Wars are Class Wars]]
[[The Rise of Carry]]
The article states: This is a fundamental flaw in the global economic system that dates back to its creation at Bretton Woods after the second world war: countries that run a persistent current account deficit will eventually be forced to adjust via a currency crisis, but there is no mechanism to discipline countries that run a persistent surplus. Yet the surplus of one country must be the deficit of another.

This doesn't seem true in China's case. A current account deficit implies a combination of a fiscal deficit and private savings deficit. If the country finances the current account deficit with local currency debt and FDI that would be less likely to lead to a currency crisis then external debt. A currency crash happens when capital inflows suddenly reverse. The question is if a carry trade is emerging in the target country. Is the currency being kept at artificially high levels? There isn't a carry trade in China, requiring a strong exchange rate. 

If China chooses the export path (which this article worries about), thatâ€™s negative for other EM exporters but positive for risk assets. It could reflate bubbles like the mid-2000s.
