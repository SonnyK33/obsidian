Many of the messages and themes in this book will be familiar. Aurelius tells us how we can truly be happy. We should live every day like it's the last and focus on enjoying the present. The book offers  advice for how to live a humble and simple life. It reminds me of “if” by Kipling. Don’t be bothered by the emotions of others, but still strive to understand them. Control your own passions. Be honest and genuine. Say what you mean.



He’s grateful to the gods for his good fortune. He wants to enjoy the comforts he has but not get spoiled by them. Existentialism draws from this school as it tells you to live your life. The point of life is to just live. However it’s not as principled. Aurelius wants to live life but not be too attached to it. And living a good life relies on sticking to these principles. Existentialism says things happen because why? While stoicism says that you have no control on external events so rely on your principles .

Everyday when you wake up, acknowledge that you will meet people who don’t abide by these principles. They’re angry, inpatient, resentful, and rude. You can’t change that. Accept it, but don’t let it change you. Embrace it with good cheer and recognize that you’re all part of one system. I don’t agree with the religious connotation, but the inevitability of meeting such people does resonate with me. The only way to live a good life is to not let them change you. All you have is reason which you should use to understand such people. Don’t try to change them, but don’t let their bad attitudes affect your end goals. We’re all responsible to each other.

He credits god with putting everything in order. That is, everything happens for a reason. I don’t agree with that. But I do agree that we need to maintain positive attitudes.

You won’t live forever so live like it’s your last day. But acts committed out of passion are worse than those committed by anger. For the latter, you have the right to react. Above all, focus on reason and community.

It’s okay to take for leisure and to learn new things. The key is to not be aimless. It’s also an error to be involved in too many things as it renders you unable to focus your attention.

  

You will never be happy if you’re focused on others.

Focus on the present, not the past or future.

If you do that, it doesn’t matter if you have a short or long life. We each only have the present. Don’t worry about the past or future, for you can’t lose what you don’t have. He again puts “aimlessness” in the same category as getting angry at nature or being moved by the actions of others. Everything you so must be focused on some end goal.

Book 3

  

Don’t worry about your remaining life getting shorter and shorter, every if you could live longer, your faculties of reason would likely dull over time. And that’s the only point I’m living anyways.

If you find something Better than living by the principles of truth and justice, then go after it. But make sure you made the right decision.

 Not sure why he includes this. I think it’s because he wants you to question everything including this text.
Live in the r moment he reminds again. All we have is the present - the past happened and the future may not happen. Our lives are small in that way. Be content with what you’re doing just like Camus’ Sisyphus. 

  

Whenever you encounter something, break it into its components. Look at its first principles and determine how it fits in the universe. Man made it, and so we should show it some respect. Understand how it fits in the broader web, as constructed by god.

We look for retreats - the beach, mountains, etc, but the best retreat is our own soul. Find peace with yourself and you won’t need to go anywhere. Don’t rely on the praise of others as it tends to be uncritical and meaningless. I think he’s saying that all people act rationally and we need to understand why they’re acting as they are. Again don’t be aimless and focus on your goals. If you’re not worse off when someone says something you couldn’t have been hurt

Everything happens for a reason and as part of some divine plan. Don’t seek out fame as everyone who remembers you will die anyways. Things and concepts that are truly beautiful don’t require praise.

You don’t need to interpret divine plan as something from god. It could also mean than everything has a cause. When faced w obstacles and adversity it can help to focus on the causes, so not to think that you’re being singled out by fate.

Only focus on what is necessary and you’ll have more time for leisure. Most things are unnecessary and you should constantly act if a given act is truly necessary. This applies to thoughts as well.

Focus on living and thinking according to justice and have a pleasant disposition. When something bad happens, think of it as being inevitable and unavoidable. It’s all written, or remember everything has a cause. Better to understand the causes then get angry.

  

Be content with what you’ve been given and your own acts. You can change others. Remember that even great men die and are forgotten eventually. Ordinary men are forgotten instantly. Life is short so live well. Don’t live as if you have 10 thousand years.

All things in the universe are connected and part of the same impulse. Everyone will die, and in the grand scheme of things, there isn’t a big difference between someone who has short life and someone with a long life. The difference is immaterial compared to the life of the universe. When you face misfortune, don’t feel bad for yourself. Call yourself fortunate for bearing the pain and still standing. Be like the rocks that are hit by waves but still standing.

Life is short though and so make it count.

Did people who lived longer really have a better life?

When you wake up do so knowing you’re going to do  man’s work. We need sleep to, but you didn’t come into the world to lay in bed all day. Look at the animals and how they do their part.

Be content with little and display those traits which are wholly in your power - sincerity, endurance, etc. Do kind things not for praise or to get the favor returned. You should do them unconsciously but should still be aware of it. Don’t seek out praise.

Ignore and don’t envy the things that don’t come by being a man. I assume he’s referring to vices like wealth or inheritances you didn’t earn. Basically only cover stuff earned as a man.

Your character will be determined by your thoughts. So think using reason and don’t waste energy on negative thoughts about others. If you encounter someone acting without reason, enlighten them. That which doesn’t hurt all man, doesn’t hurt you. This can refer to your family or broader society. If someone does you wrong, it’s in their nature. Your response is based on your nature. Many who encounter adversity persevere through ignorance and vanity. Those traits shouldn’t be stronger than reason - ie you should overcome them as well.

Don’t flatter yourself or take yourself too seriously

Try to see things at their core and ignore the flattery and dressings that get attached to them 

For example, an excellent meal may just be a dead animal

You should value well reasoned arguments or things that are put together in your head (ie things that you fully understand) above all else

Only seek and prize what you need. He relates it to raising children- you take care of their basic needs. He has a good line where he refers to the praise of masses as the clapping of tongues and as analogous to clapping of hands.

  

If you are hurt by someone, don’t make them your enemy, just avoid them.

Don’t let your soul die before the body.

Be understanding to those who are irrational and inanimate - including circumstances. But treat fellow man as rational.

We should be indifferent to all things not in our power. The only things that can be good or evil are those in our power. All things step from universal reason. We follow the rules of our profession but sometimes forget the power of reason in ordinary life. Even bad things stem from universal reason and some higher plan. Like the fountain analogy. All of us are either working with the universe, blind to what’s going on, or working against it. Choose which you want to be.

He once again emphasizes that all men die and so we should be try to be content. Everything is about perspective. To a child, a ball is a treasure he says. That’s because the child only thinks in the present and focused on his own actions. We shouldn’t care about what others think of us, nor focus just on our feelings, but rather on our actions.

  

Gods are unlikely unconcerned with us as individuals, but rather the universe as a whole. So don’t take things personally. If there is no god, we can still stay happy by focusing on reason and our own actions. 

  

When someone says something you don’t like, try to emphasize and understand where it’s coming from.

  

Think of life as theatre, things repeat, and nothing is permanent.

There is nothing new under the sun. Whenever you see someone not using reason or guilty of something else, remember that you’ve likely seen this before. Or someone else has.

Last entry was start of book 7

Focus on the present and don’t be pulled by passions. Analyze why people are the way they are. Recognize what they’re going through and understand cause and effect. If someone does you wrong that’s on them.

Embrace whatever position you’re in. Take every risk necessary and don’t worry about anything except dishonoring yourself.

Privilege of the rational person to not be moved by bodily needs or desires. That is, don’t see this as a sacrifice but as a privilege. A source of resilience and invincibility.

Being happy depends on the fewest possible things. Don’t give into pain and when you’re reacting badly to something afflicting you recognize that you’re giving into to it. When something negative happens know that those who reacted badly to similar things went nowhere. You know that from your own experience. Instead use these things to your advantage. What different courses of action can you now take? What haven’t you considered before? Would other people be affected similarly and can you help them? will you encounter this thing again? Are you in the wrong here and can you improve something?

Everything is written and has been in motion for a long time. That should be a source of serenity for you. It’s not a bad thing because remember you only need a few things to be happy. Live every day like it’s your last and don’t be agitated. Remember when you are at your happiest.

Live your life by core axioms. What makes a man good or evil. What is important to you? These principles should drive everything, and beyond them, you shouldn’t care what anyone thinks of you. Live your life as nature intended, by which he means by these axioms.

Just as nature takes all events and actions and uses them for its goals, we must do the same. When something occurs, take it for granted, and see how you can use it. Don’t get mad. And remember to focus on the present. When something bad occurs, ask your self if it’s truly a big deal in and of itself.

Accept everything for its intrinsic worth rather than get angry.

Don’t wait for the future because you’ll probably be disappointed. The people will be no better than who you deal with now.

Most of our problems are in our imagination and we can solve them on our own.

Instead of praying for stuff we want and have no control over, ask to be freed from lust, desire, and fear. As an example, rather than asking for protection for your children, ask to not be afraid that something happens to them. This is much easier said than done. I think his point isn’t that you shouldn’t care about something happening to your children, but rather acknowledge that that isn’t in your control. Don’t ask God to have control over things you cannot. Rather, ask to be stronger and more in control over your emotions. That will make you more resilient and more appreciative of the the present moment.

It doesn’t really matter to us whether others are acting in accordance w justice so don’t worry about it. Think about all of the forces around us that we can’t see - those that create life in a mothers womb for instance. Trying to understand them is a better use of time. Try to understand the mutual change of all things. Focus on that scientific enquiry.

To be rational is to submit to things we can’t control. The irrational get mad about things out of their control like the pig squealing when he’s about to be slaughtered.

When you encounter someone acting poorly, ask yourself if you’ve ever done the same. What were your aims? Why’d you do it?

Original point of tragic plays was to show that misfortune was a part of life. We shouldn’t fear what we enjoy watching on stage.

Your adherence to these principles should be obvious. People should sense your intellectual honesty just from being around you and you shouldn’t have to say anything.

It’s not acts that bother us but our opinions of them.avoid forming those opinions by remembering that the actions of others can’t harm us. Kindness is irresistible and it may change others to your benefit.

Last book

  

You can have everything that you pray for if you live in the present

We value ourselves above others by value others’ opinions about ourselves over our own

When we die, if we’re able to see the earth and everyone’s affairs, we’ll see how fleeting everything is and how nothing is unique. We’d see how everyone is concerned with frivolous issues. He reminds us again that only the present moment is ours, and it’s all we can lose.

We can’t control how long we’ll live. God decides when it’s over. We can’t control when we die, so leave the earth fulfilled. Enjoy and make the most of the present.
