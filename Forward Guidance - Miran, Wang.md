The new Fed lending facility (post-SVB) is partially unsecured, as banks are able to borrow par. This will create Japanese style zombie banks as many insolvent ones will be on a life line just waiting for their collateral to pull to par. 

This goes against the Bagehot principle -They're lending against bad collateral now.

This will decrease credit growth and deposits will flow out of regionals. Those with big CRE portfolios and small securities portfolio may still fail. We may see flows into treasuries and MMF, the latter of which will show up in RRP.

The Fed can only guarantee deposits of banks in receivership. Per Dodd-Frank, guaranteeing all would require act of Congress.

How the new facility works -

The Fed creates a new LLC which gets 20bn equity from the treasury. The Fed then levers that up by lending to it (did 30:1 during Covid I think). That LLC then uses the capital to lend against banks’ treasury portfolio. So there's zero credit risk which is what the fed wants.  

In the short-term, regional banks will sell duration and other assets. In the long term, those who survive will be less likely to sell duration or hedge rate risk given this Fed facility. In short term you have those Zombie banks borrowing at 5pct from the Fed facility to service 3pct earning assets.  

**Borrowing par against discount bonds creates liquidity (Kindleburger)**

  
The new facility is only borrowing against treasuries and agencies so benefits bigger banks more than regional who typically have more loans. The latter can use home Loan fed banks to borrow against mortgages. Those banks wouldn’t help SVB because it had negative tangible equity bc of HTM portfolio.

That may change now and is where a lot of liquidity will come from. Deposit rates will increase and credit growth will slow. The economy just got a lot more rate sensitive which means Powell may be done. There will be less credit creation given higher deposit rates or less deposits. But stocks have to fall if the fed is done hiking or may cut.
