Because of bank reserves are not scarce and banks actually earn interest on them, they are not part of the monetary base that the government can inflate away. Only physical cash can pay the inflation tax, and an extremely high inflation rate would be necessary to inflate away debt (40%). The more likely option is that the government will require banks to hold reserves and/or pay a lower rate on them. This in turn will drive down deposit rates, and lead to financial repression.

Thinking about Pettis' argument about financial repression in China and Germany, I wondered what this would imply about the US. Lower deposit rates (in real terms), will shift economic gains away from consumers. That would lead to less consumption and more savings. This may be offset with higher fiscal deficits, leading to no changes in its external position. If the fiscal deficit was unchanged, it would lead to a smaller current account deficit, and fewer capital inflows. 

The US banking system was initially set up to benefit agrarian interests whereas the Canadian system was meant to be stable and favored federal policies. The American system has always been more populist. In the current reserve system where banks don’t have to hold reserves and in fact get paid on them, the only base for inflation tax is physical currency. We would need 40% inflation to pay with that constraint. That’s the only tax base because that’s only place where you’re not compensated for just holding cash. The government is getting a tax for the interest it doesn’t have to pay on physical cash. The inflation tax is the inflation rate x govt borrowings that do not earn interest. An alternative to 40pct inflation tax would be to expand base by requiring banks to hold reserves and to stop paying interest on them or at least lower rates. This tax on banks would hit depositors too but would be easier politically than a high inflation rate. 

This is consistent  with what other countries do when they're facing fiscal dominance. Financial repression hits depositors and consumers. Does this imply shifting to a savings and investment vs consumption led economy ?
  
**In conjunction with QE**

The Fed has treasuries but it isn’t paying interest on reserves. So the interest from bonds is profit which it will pay back to treasury. In effect, the treasury isn’t paying interest on those bonds. There's a ceiling on debt/GDP driven by the GDP growth rate and real interest rate. Debt to GDP is driven by a nominal cost of debt and the GDP growth rate. At a 2% growth rate, current debt to GDP is unsustainable. We will start to see higher rates demanded by market to compensate for inflation and deficits.
