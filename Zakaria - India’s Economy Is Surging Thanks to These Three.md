India is now the largest country in the world and the fastest growing large economy. There’s three big changes behind that.

1) Aadhar - a digital ID assigned to every Indian covers 99.9pct of adults. It makes it easy to access credit and may allow small businesses to create more jobs. It’s state owned.  

2) Jio - Reliance’s cheap mobile plan has dramatically increased mobile data usage. Per capita mobile data usage is higher than US and China combined.  

3) a large increase in infrastructure spending. Government capital spending 5x since 2014.

What's funding the government's increase in investment? Either savings rates are higher, or the trade deficit is higher. A savings deficit implies a trade deficit - the investment must be funded from a capital account surplus. That is, foreigners are buying Rupee debt rather than Indian exports. Has the Aadhar system led to a higher savings rate? Geo Alpha author argued that India's banking system (and tax avoidance by the rich) had led to a lower savings rate. Has this changed?
