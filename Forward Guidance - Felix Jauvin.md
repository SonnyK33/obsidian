While Fed was still conducting QE, they started offering yield on the RRP facility - 5bps over the lower bound which sterilized liquidity coming from QE. QE often increases M2 because banks want to get their treasuries back and so buy them from clients in exchange for bank deposits.   

MMFs haven't withdrawn from RRP as it's yielding higher than bills with no duration risk. He measures system wide liquidity as: 

SOMA portfolio - TGA account - RRP balance   

Foreign sovereigns likely to break - that is, they'll need dollars or there could be something like the gilt crisis before repo market breaks again. JGP crash could be the tail event, caused by the new governor. This could be what causes lower dollar and higher long term yields.

  
Recommendations:
Peak dollar since the ECB and BOJ getting more hawkish
Expects a weaker dollar but high long term yields which will hurt risk assets and suck out liquidity 

This assumes Fed reaches terminal rate and stays there while other banks are more hawkish. As a consequence, the Fed may have to intervene again to restore liquidity. Could then see inflation spike in 24 as structural issues not dealt with. 

Will see goods deflation as inventories build and rent inflation will revert.
  
If there’s a tail event in sovereign liquidity that will lead to pivot and you should buy stocks, commodities, and crypto.

Cu (and oil) led declines in CPI and may raise before the latter rises - should buy soon ahead of a pivot

Buy BTC and ETH ahead of pivot. FTX didn’t own much of these so won’t be selling. 
GBTC blowing up would hurt thesis
