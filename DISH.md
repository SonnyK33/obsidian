11.16.22
**Capex Plans**
- likely moving to a success based capex model, i.e. reaching minimum level of buildout versus initial 10bn target (will get to 70% buildout target)
- the new 2bn maturity just gets through 2023 capex spend and may get it to the point where it won't lose licenses to the FCC
	- Ergen said only need to spend 2bn to get to 70% target
- but the network won't be large enough to be profitable  
- post this 2bn they'll get to 5.6bn of capex spend (vs the initial 10bn target) - spent 3.1bn prior too this 2bn deal

**Build out Plans**
- 30-40% of towers don't make any money and you're better off paying roaming costs (you only build to say you have full coverage)
- owner economics - costs $10-20m to build a tower for an NFL stadium vs $100k for annual roaming fees
	- i.e. need a tower because of density during peak periods
- government can only forfeit if haven't built out 75% of coverage for a given pop-area
	- so may just lose in a few small pop's
- no renumeration if FCC licenses lost to government, but government not incentivized to do that
- by the time 70% full coverage reached (this year), will be 75% in most pop's
- need to get to 15k towers to avoid fines, currently at 10k and building 1k/month



**Spectrum Available**
- has 150MHz of  mid (1-6 GHz) and low (<1 GHz) band spectrum (most useful for 5G)
	- for auction 110 (nov 21 deal) - about 30Mhz
	-  18 of 600 band used for Nov 22 deal
	- 100 Mhz of unencumbered spectrum left
- DBS secured capacity ($4bn) may be saved for DTV
- AT&T and VZ don't own 110; only TMUS is likely buyer 
	- only soft caps on spectrum owned by one player so antitrust issues may not be severe
- VZ doesn't own any AWS-3, so should be a buyer 
- 700 Mhz of E-block (Dish and Qualcomm were buyers)
	- latter sold to AT&T
	- AT&T would be a buyer 
- H block may not have buyers - linked to lightsquare 
- only buyer of interco collateral (110 auction) was AT&T; they bid that up


**DBS Value**
- DirectTV traded hands w/ TPG in the 4x-ish range 
- 
**IR**
- can try Jason Keiser (Treasurer); can talk to DB
