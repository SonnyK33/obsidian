No Exit is a play taking place in hell. A group of strangers are ushered into a room which they discover is hell and begin discussing what brought them there. At some point they realize that the door to the room is open and they can leave at any time. Despite this, they choose to stay and continue fighting with one another. The famous line - "Hell is other people" - summarizes the story. We allow ourselves to be judged and criticized by others even when we can leave whenever we want. We have free will but we don't exercise it. Sarte's makes the case for existentialism by showing the power of free will and how we choose to play by others' rules. 

Hell is a room with no windows and with a light that never turns off. You can’t sleep and there aren’t any books. There isn’t a torture chamber as some assume. They finally acknowledge that they’re in hell. There’s no torturer and they’ve realized that each is the torturer for the rest. They get on each others nerves but in a playful, frivolous, Seinfeld-esque manner.

Some of their crimes seem major and some less so. Hell is other people. Even though Garcia can leave he craves approval from Inez. We need approval from others even when we’re literally dead. 
When Estelle tries to kill Inez and fails (because they’re dead) they all laugh at the absurdity of it all. 

Has Camus like take on absurdity of life and repeating things over and over seemingly for no reason. Even in death we can’t escape this. In some ways takes the Sisyphus argument is taken one step further - beyond death .
  
Why does he need Inez’s approval? Why do they get jealous of one another? 
We live for other people
