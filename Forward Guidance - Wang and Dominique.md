[[A Monetary and Fiscal History of the US 1961-2021]]


In a high inflation regime core and energy inflation are correlated. Energy prices came down in the last few months which also brought down core inflation. China's reopening will push up oil and bring up core inflation by mid 2023.

She argues an 8pct fed funds makes sense per the Taylor rule. She isn't saying this will be the rate, but that it needs to be much higher barring a demand shock or an energy price shock. 

Fiscal deficits have grown (like during the 1980s  under Reagan when the Fed was also tightening; this will cause higher real rates as it did back then). So far, higher rates aren’t affecting real estate in the US due to fixed rate mortgages. Consumers also have strong balance sheets after past 10 years of excess liquidity pumped into the system. Credit growth has also continued. It was actually accelerated with higher lending rates. The credit boom in 2022 may have a lagging impact on 2023. Goods inflation has come down as people switched to services.  

Shelter inflation is driven by wages not house prices, and so rent inflation may not come down as quickly as some think. The moderation in wage inflation recently is due to the cutting temporary workers (e.g. contract nurses). This trend won’t continue, and median wages are still high.

The Fed's inflation measure - core pce ex housing - is driven by wages. As long as wages keep growing, inflation won't get to the Fed's required level.  Consumer money comes from wages (growing), credit creation(growing), and assets (stabilized) so why would inflation fall?

**Reserves and Fed Balance Sheet**

Pre-GFC, only New Zealand and Norway used the abundant reserve regime. NZ because fiscal policy was so tight there wasn’t enough collateral, and Norway because they were making volatile payments to the treasury tied to oil prices. That led to volatile reserve balances. Both abandoned these policies because you can’t control the quantity and price of money at the same time and because it kills the money markets. Money markets have gotten much smaller relative to govt debt

QT has a larger impact during a period of rising rates. QE works because people swap their deposits for higher yielding assets. The delta between deposit rates and yields are even higher now. QT will reverse this flow and we don’t know what impact the winding down of such a big balance sheet will be. Dominique thinks QT will end early because of issues with reserves. Even now some banks are borrowing at the Fed's discount window. It will be difficult to treat RRP and bank reserves as fungible unless the fed funds rate goes down (or banks increase deposit rates - she doesn’t address this). QT is  mainly coming from bank reserves vs the RRP is a headwind for asset prices. This is becaus lower bank reserves will mean less lending at some point. In turn that means less credit growth. 
  
There's a risk that QT hits liquidity for treasuries similar to the UK situation.  

The inverted curve makes it more expensive for foreign buyers of treasuries to buy and hedge 
FX risk (Japan is the most important example). This means yields need to go up. 

Dominique expects the Fed to raise dots by another pp this year and that inflation won’t come down because of pent up demand. She thinks the curve could invert much more. Her reference is the oil shock when it inverted 200 bps. She thinks of 2s10s as a proxy for perception vs reality on inflation, and hence expects it to invert much more. This year the
Inflation number will be a shock.

**Debt Ceiling - 5/30/23**
The fed has various ways of prioritizing payments to avoid a default. If the limit is breached, the Fed would probably allow holders to swap defaulted notes for current ones. The Treasury also issues a lot of non-marketable debt for inter-governmental use. It will stop rolling those notes to prioritize. 

Pre-GFC, the Fed kept money in commercial banks. Hence when they borrowed, it wasn't as much of a liquidity train as it today.
