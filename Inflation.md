**FX pass through inflation**
- strong dollar has exported a lot of inflation and is in the context of growing conflict with China
	- energy imports are dollar-based
	- requires China to keep large dollar holdings and furthers dollar hegemony


**EM Inflation**
- Turkey has very high rates of inflation (60%) but public sector wages have been raised to kleep up
- there's also a public healthcare system
- point is that some countries can withstand higher rates of inflation (not the US), but at a cost of business competitiveness
- important to keep this in mind when reading commentaries about countries like Turkey or Venezuela
	- high rates of inflation don't hurt everyone equally
	- the poor with no financial assets and public sector wages may be okay
- in Turkey, landlords who have rent control and corporations seeking foreign investment have been the losers
	- may not matter, depending who's in power
