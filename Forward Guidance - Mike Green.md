Takeaways: Unemployment is a lagging indicator, and it's been increasing. Higher rates may lead to even more inflation because we're supply constrained. Longer-dated options may be best trade for vol spike caused by 0DTE options. 


Unemployment is a lagging indicator and is ticking up. So far cuts have targeted knowledge workers with high severance who have no need to file for paltry unemployment benefits. So unemployment claims are understating number of unemployed. There's fewer number of people without college degrees who will do low skill jobs, which is leading to a tight market at the lower-end. 

**Auto Debt**
For Americans having a car means being able to work. They’ll choose a car over a house as you can rent or stay with friends. You need the car to work, and it’s also harder to discharge auto debt post 2005 reforms.  

  
It's hard to see where the capacity to spend more will come from. Snap benefits and others enacted during Covid are being reduced. Credit card debt is increasingly expensive. Unemployment is already at the lows, but wages are increasing. The rich do have more to spend because of higher interest rates, and so you could argue that higher rates is increasing their ability to spend. 

He makes the case that an increase in rates could increase the value of tech because they increase call prices. I think that’s false - higher rates increase the value of a call relative to the underlying and holding all else equal. Tesla stock is a call on EV manufacturing capacity ie the assets. If those assets lose value with higher rates so does the call though the call may do relatively better. It also depends on how much optionality is embedded in the price. 2022 saw a major rebalancing by traditional targeted portfolios. Bonds went down with higher rates and so they had to sell stocks and buy bonds. This hit the largest market cap stocks the most. 2023 so far has been CTAs and tax loss sellers following trends and focusing on inelastic stocks that move up the more they move up (ARK etc)

Higher rates when we’re supply constrained and trying to decouple from China will lead to less investment in productive capacity and hence more inflation. If low rates are used to finance consumption that can be deflationary as you consume less in the future (per lacey hunt). 

Passive investors are inelastic in buying and selling. They sell the winners and liquid stocks and buy the outperfoemers. That plus Inelastic retail creates vol esp on the downside.

0DTE options allow participants to hide their exposure. Imagine if Bill Huang was able to hide his exposure. Single day options don't require margin and don't clear (I think). Green thinks longer-dated options would benefit the most from a vol spike incident that hurts single day option sellers. Single day buyers would also gain but would be a one-time gain. Could make more with longer-dated. Would expect long skew to do well.
