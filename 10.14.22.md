Stocks were down 2.3% today on poor retail numbers and higher inflation expectations. It feels like market still digesting data from last few days. There's also a lot of changes in the UK (the finance minister was fired, and the tax plan was revoked).  There's some talk of a Russian ceasefire, though I think that's an optimistic read. My SPY puts were still down today, due due theta overcoming the price move.
