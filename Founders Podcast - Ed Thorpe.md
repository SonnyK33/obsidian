Saw his life as similar to investing/gambling - a mix of luck and chance. It's important to expose yourself to different things - change the cards you’re dealt. 

Take nothing for granted - eg don't just assume the market is efficient 

Beware of rigged games - eg Nevada regularities captured by casinos 

Avoid ruin - Kelly criterion - shaped by Great Depression 

Play on your edge - and avoid other games

Life about spending time well. Be a satisfier not maximizer - ie look for good enough solutions that don’t draw too much time from what actually matters.
