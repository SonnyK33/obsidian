**Forward Rates**
Forwards are spot prices less carry, and carry is yield less financing costs. Higher repo rates lowers forward prices because it's more expensive to hold a spot position. Current repo rates (1.10.23) are so high that carry on treasuries and IG bonds is negative (forwards are higher). This means in order to breakeven on a position, you need a certain amount of tightening to pay for carry. 


**Treasury futures**
Futures are forwards on the CTD bond. From repo rates, you can calculate the forward price and vice versa. 

Futures px = forward price on the CTD - option value (what is this? option to not take delivery?)

The repo rate implied by the futures price is the implied rate. If the implied rate is higher than the actual repo rate, carry is low in futures and futures are too high. The above option value could explain the arb, if it's in the other direction (i.e. futures look cheap.)
