**Liquidity**

Thinks RRP balances will rise due to MMFs choosing it over lower yielding treasuries. 
Policy yields will rise because the Fed will continue tightening due to strong labour markets and consumer balance sheets. T-bill yields will stay depressed relative to the RRP due to demand from consumers. This is in line with my thinking on the banks having to raise deposit rates at some point and the difficulties with QT. There's also there’s a tbill shortage, exacerbated by the debt ceiling fight.  

Yellen is issuing bills earlier than thought (through her ability to borrow without renewing the debt ceiling). This will increase the spread between bills and RRP and pull funds from latter. This will increase ability of HFs to take on leverage (not sure how?)

Since labour market is strong, Fed will likely continue to raise rates through a recession which will force S&P below 3k. Doesn't think the recession comes in the first half due to the strong labour markets and balance sheets. But as the fed continues to tighten, it will bring a recession in the second half.

Thinks the S&P hits 3600 and then rallies due to pivot but then back to 2800. The big tail risk is that the reduction in liquidity (which he calls phase 2) happens before a pivot happens due to strong labour market.  

There is higher structural inflation due to geopolitics. This leads to more inflation and GDP volatility. Increases in inflation expectations and inflation increases yields and term premia. This is what happened in the 60s and 70s. UST may not benefit from t flight to quality in a recession due to inflation vol. Another consequence is that 60-40 portfolios are dead in medium term. This year may see a rally in bonds due to a recession, but it won’t be as strong as before. It also means a sectoral shift from growth to value, large cap (which could manufacture CF) to small cap and from DM to EM (this also fits with the peak dollar theme).

The new carry trade is taking advantage of higher inflation.  He likes gold but not yet, as the market is pricing in 6 more hikes at ECB vs Fed. This may not be realistic, and the Euro may have run too far. So in the short term, there may still be dollar strength.

Expecting Chinese stimulus in Q1 based on guidance from the PBOC. 

**Three Possible Outcomes**

Most likely - 
No recession until mid 2023 at the earliest. The job market will remain tight as unemployment doesn’t increase unless people see a recession. Hence the Fed will keep raising, getting to 5.5-6. They can’t pivot unless there's a recession

The right tail is transitory Goldilocks - that’s what equities are pricing in currently.
The fed pivoted in Dec; the reaction function is now overemphasizing labour and under emphasizing inflation (which cares about disinflation, so it has ignored this "pivot"). The cohesion of the dot plot signals that FOMC members may not react to a recession the way the market is expecting. Their required cuts to PCE and increases to unemployment are already implicitly forecasting a recession. So when that happens, they may not react by cutting as people hope. There needs to be a much deeper recession than people are expecting to get cuts. Will need to wait till March and/or June FOMC meetings to shake off the Goldilocks narrative. Until then, China reopening and declining inflation are the dominant narratives.

The left tail is US isn’t as resilient as people think and a recession comes sooner than q4. This isn’t priced in at all and so is a cheap hedge. It’s unlikely post China reopening but not impossible.

Have to trade beta in the range until one of the tails becomes more likely 
  
Buying bonds if you believe in the left tail makes sense.Not if you believe in the modal outcome as everyone still tightening. 

PMI is worrying but 80pct+ of gdp is in services.

Average mortgage rate for people in the US is still below 4pct as no one buying. Consumer balance sheets still strong 

  
Thinks of the dollar as the residual of the supply/demand balance of credit in the global system. A weak dollar helps cyclicals over defensive, EM over DM, commodities over digital. 
Chinese equities are still cheap relative to DM and given allocations. Whole world was sucked out of China because of fears of a new Cold War. Conciliatory moves will reverse this.
