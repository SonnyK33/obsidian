Instigated by the fire in Xinjang region, small groups of Chinese people have started protesting against Covid zero. China has been forced to ease restrictions but have been afraid to open up too quickly. The medical infrastructure can’t handle even a low death rate that may be realized in an opening. Authorities are weary of the protests and think they are being partially funded or organized by western forces. That may be partially true, but stands to reason that many people are tired of the lockdown.

The government may mistakenly downplay the protests by assuming they’re all organized by the US. This isn’t the same as the HK protests.
