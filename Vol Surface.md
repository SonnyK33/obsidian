**Term Structure**
Vol term structure describes varying implied volatilities for different option maturities, assuming same strike and underlying. Vol term structure tends to be upward sloping. 

**Relative Value Trades**

People tend to overpay for medium term puts and there’s likely value in short term (weekly or less) or long term puts. Some statistical studies show that returns have very fat tails for short term horizons (4 or less days), and hence there’s value in buying weekly OTM puts. Since volatility begets more volatility, you can wait for the first move before buying a weekly put. This is a better strategy than continuously buying and rolling. Though time decay is severe, you’re already paying less as most of the heavily decaying days have already occurred. The fact that continuosly rolling puts is a losing trade implies that you're paying for convexity - more evidence of fat tails.

On risk adjusted basis, skew is highest for 30day period bc that’s a popular timeframe to buy protection. There may be RV trades in earlier or later maturities. 30 days - 3 months tend to be the most popular timeframes for options. 

Long-dated options can also provide value. They have the highest Vega/theta ratio but are not gamma plays the way short-dated options are. Longer-dated options also have much higher rho. Given the effects on forward prices, a cut in dividend helps long-dates call prices. Higher dividends, or lower (r-d) causes the forward curve to move into backwardation, lowering forwards, and benefiting long-dated puts.

After a risk event, long-term vol may still be cheap, especially in other asset classes (when you expect all asset classes to eventually correlate). Short term vol will be high, but Vega on short-term options is low so options may still be cheap. So you want to buy long term options before a risk event happens and short term options after a risk event, as a last resort. Weekly options benefit from contagion effects that occur in the short term. They have lots of gamma and are less affected by vol and so they offer value after a move. Long-dated options reprice on sentiment.

Structured products eg those offering yield to retail customers in Japan may rely on long term option writing and hence create opportunities for cheap long term options.You buy long term options when investors are overly optimistic so you can benefit when sentiment changes. You should check this now. Should also check for the forward to spot premium as this will prob come down.

Short term market shocks may cause term structure of vol to invert, though this is normally temporary and the curve is generally upward sloping. Short term vol tends to have much higher beta then long term. For example if we regress different expiry ATM implied vol to 3m ATM vol and graph the betas against the time to maturity, it’s downward sloping and convex. That is 1 week ATM vol is high and it rapidly comes down as maturity increases. For longer dated options, skew is much flatter— that is OTM implied vol isn’t much higher than ATM. Skew is negatively correlated with time to maturity .

**The focus of vol surface modeling should be to determine what strikes/maturities will move the most with a change in the underlying. Figure out which parts are most in need of hedging and/or will give the most bang for your buck.**
