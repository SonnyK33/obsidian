Debt ceiling crisis could have accelerated if it wasn't handled. Cutting spending due to the debt ceiling would also lead to lower revenue which would lead to lower spending etc. Tax revenues are paid from government spending, so it's circular.

QE and QT don’t affect inflation because they just shift money from savings to checking accounts. Spending and taxes do affect it, as evidenced by the post-covid stimulus.  

Rate hikes are inflationary because the treasury has to spend more on interest. It's not just new bill issuance. The Fed bought 6tr during QE, and it has to pay interest on the reserves it created.
They shifted money from from savings to checking accounts i.e. treasury securities to fed account when it conducted QE. Duration was shortened through QE. The higher reinvestment rates also changes behavior of corporates, and could be expansionary depending on their credit status. 

In the 1970s when mortgage rates were high, you had really high housing starts because income was higher. Net-net, higher rates have increased the deficit which is stimulative. Most of the funds are going to the wealthy i.e. savers who own treasuries, but they're still spending some of it. Debt / GDP has tripled compared to last cycle when you consider the debt held by the public. Most of the new spending went to people rather than social security and other agencies so the mix shifted.   

Even Krugman acknowledged this; if deficits are too high, the government can’t raise rates as they become inflationary. In the late 1970s, deficits were 6% but inflation was 23%, so debt was going down. Along with the spike in oil prices, that’s what caused the recession.  (Currently, the US deficit is ~5%, under the inflation rate, so debt is increasing - which should be expansionary). Tax receipts were also going up, as people were pushed to higher brackets. This became contractionary as it wasn’t being spent fast enough. That's linked to the inflation versus deficit argument. The inflation rate exceeded the deficit, which was contractionary. Shouldn't the relevant measure be deficit growth versus inflation rate? The deficit as of May 2023 was $1.1tr vs 430bn, a rate that well exceeds inflation. From 1982-83, the deficit rose >60% (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FYFSD), so that seems to contradict this argument.

Volcker’s rate increases contributed to inflation which became contractionary because the government didn’t spend it fast enough. That is, it's the fiscal cuts that tamed inflation. Rate hikes in 1970s and 80s fed inflation through higher interest rates putting more money in people's
hands. This inflation lowered the value of debt outstanding which was deflationary. Taxes also rose faster than spending due to inflation. So I think he’s saying inflation was cut by less fiscal spending.

In some countries labour has more power and a wage price spiral is real, like in turkey. This isn't the case in the US. This cycle, along with higher interest, defense spending is up in line with inflation, as is social security. There are winners and losers with a rising deficit, but overall we have higher Interest expense, which is now is 1.5x the military budget.  

The economy is net saver. In the private sector every dollar borrowed is also saved, but govt is a net payer of interest. Although recipients of interest income have higher propensity to save, at least some of it is being spent. The Fed St Louis's corporate profitability numbers include the Fed which is losing money on interest on reserves. Without that, corporate profits are up. You have to combine the treasury with the Fed when calculating total dollars printed. Only 1/6 of treasury bills are paying higher rates, but the Fed's portfolio of 6-8 trillion is paying higher rates on reserves.   

In Argentina, the peso is devalued which raises import prices which passes through into inflation further weakening the peso and so on. The issues is Debt/GDP. If it’s high enough, the interest received by savers will overcome the decreases in borrowing and higher rates are inflationary. 
The difference is in propensities between savers and borrowers. If debt gets high enough, you  can’t use higher rates to slow the economy. Does it help savers more than hurts borrowers.

MMT argues against the crowding out theory because you spend first, and then the private sector borrows. Crowding out thus doesn’t happen in a floating rate system. It’s different if exchange rates are fixed and pegged to gold. Japan, Korea, Germany etc buy treasuries to support their own exporters over households. They have a savings led growth model per Pettis.
