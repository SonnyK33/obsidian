- retailers are becoming advertising businesses by earning advertising revenue from brands
- AMZN is the biggest beneficiary of this trend and ad revenue is now the second biggest revenue contributor after AWS and out-earns the prime segment
- AMZN advertising is likely more profitable for brands than GOOGL or META ads since you can more easily track which ads lead to sales (since the purchase is being made on the same site)
	- Apple's changes to iOS privacy settings are also making it harder for META to track user behaviour across apps
	- although this affects AMZN's Demand Side Platform (DPS) which tracks user behavior, some estimate that the Apple privacy change only affects 8% of ad inventory in DPS (see Vox article)
	- GOOGL is also taking out certain cookies which track user behavior 
- some brands now have to spend 10-20% of AMZN sales revenue on ads which is leading to higher prices 
- more advanced in US than Europe where privacy controls are stronger 
**Implications**
- bad for META and GOOGL, good for AMZN and other retailers
	- FB and GOOGL currently dominate digital ad spend; AMZN ad revenue is ~50% of Googles but is growing much faster (see chart on FT article)
	- WMT earns much less than AMZN but is growing - grew 30% in Q3'22
- common argument that technology is disinflationary - AMZN lowers prices by disintermediation`
	- this trend shows that technology isn't disinflationary but rather the sudden jump in technology is disinflationary
	- AMZN did decrease prices, but as its business has gotten more competitive, they've introduced new revenue streams (like ads) which brands have to pay and hence pass on the consumers, which brings prices back up 
		- e.g. department stores were probably disinflationary at some point as well, but then they started charging brands for product placement which was passed on to consumers etc
- because these retail ads have better data than social media ads (because of the regulatory changes and simply because the purchase is on the same site), they're getting a bigger share of ad budgets (esp in inflationary times where brands have to be more choosy)
- the retailers best positioned to profit from this trend are those that sell a variety of goods and brands as it allows for the best data (AMZN, WMT, etc)
	- was one of the factors that led to the Krogers/Albertsons deal - both had advertising arms, but combining them would target 80m+ consumers 
- makes brands more likely to choose retailers over DTC (bad for brands like AWAY or PTON)
