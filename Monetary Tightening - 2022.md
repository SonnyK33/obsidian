When China entered WTO in 2001, was the start of cheap goods on the west. Western central banks were afraid of deflation and so lowered rates - this has led to excess leverage 
- Walter bagehot- Lombard street - argued central banks should lend at higher rates against good collateral 
	- The first treatise on what central banks should do
- Fed is reducing balance sheet by a third from 9.5tr and says that’s the equivalent of 25 bps - Crossmark Capital  think it’s actually 500bps and doesn’t think it’ll happen - thinks will crash system and pivot coming in early 2023
- believes there's a 8–9 month lag between fed policy and change in market though is faster if returning funds to system that’s been deprived


**Limitations from Raising Rates**
- stock vs flow effect 
	- stock effect refers to effects of higher rates on household and corporate wealth
		- for now, this seems to have levelled off 
	- the flow effect is the impact of incremental tightening
	- higher rates mean that corporates are collecting higher interest income on their cash balances and hence higher rates are subsidizing some
	- at some point, higher rates have the opposite impact 
	- this is the argument made by #Turkey for why not raising rates
- may mean Fed needs to do more aggressive hikes
