VW is investing a lot in EV including new plants in Canada and China. 
The former benefits from US tax credits (IRA) as well as specific canadiam subsidies. It earns
60pct of profits in China however and so can’t leave that market. Unlike most other auto companies they’re building their own batteries.

This captures the dilemma of most automakers. They can't abandon China which is producing more cars then ever now. They're also being forced to invest in the US to capture new subsidies. Soon they'll be lured in by their domestic governments as well.
