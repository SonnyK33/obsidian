The UK is facing the greatest amounts of labour actions since the late 1980s. 1979 was known as the winter of discontentment. If they give into demands it will entrench inflation, but the labour market is tight and workers have a lot of bargaining power. Nurses are striking for the first time and there are 47k vacancies, giving them more bargaining power. The Tories are also losing popularity and are at risk of losing the majority to the Labour party. 

The US is also seeing more labour actions. This fits with the broader theme of a lower labour supply globally (including the US), and a less elastic labour force. Powell, during his Brookings speech in November, basically conceded the fight to raise Labour Force Participation rates which continue to fall, despite higher wages. He said that he believes the natural rate of unemployment is higher than they thought in the past. Worth pointing out that unemployment is higher in most developed countries due to a stronger welfare system and public healthcare. All of this means structurally higher inflation.
