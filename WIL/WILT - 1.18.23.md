The future is very path dependent. I've been thinking back to the aliens in Slaughter House Five who can see all things at once and have no sense of time. My first thought was that maybe we shouldn't see eveything as causal; sometimes things just happen. The other takeaway though is that as strange as the aliens' view seems to be, we claim to do that all the time. We'll make a call about the future and forget about the path dependency.  This becomes more of a risk the further out you forecast. We're calling for a hard landing and a double dip inflation issue. That could happen, but it's important to remember that the second phase of that won't be apparent for a long time. Pretending we can forecast a complex multi-step future like that is saying we can do what the aliens can do. 

Liquidity has been increasing because of flows coming from the RRP which fell by $211 bn. At the same time, TGA balances have been falling due to the lack of issuances (partially caused by debt ceiling issues). When banks participate in the RRP they exchange bank reserve assets for RRP assets and the Fed does the opposite - extinguishes bank reserve liabilities and creates RRP liabilities. When they withdraw from the facility, the opposite happens. That is, the Fed settles the withdrawal from the RRP by increasing bank reserves (not giving them cash). As would be expected with the RRP decrease, bank reserves are up $250bn in the past 7 days.

Banks could be withdrawing from the RRP to buy bills as the spread has narrowed. But that should lead to TGA balances increasing and bank reserves falling again (I think).


**Reverse repo with commercial banks**
Commercial banks with excess reserves (too much liquidity) can lend them back to Fed using the RRP and get treasuries as collateral. They sell the treasuries back to the Fed at a higher rate, thus earning the reverse repo rate. This temporarily converts their reserve asset into a RRP asset (i.e. a loan to the fed collateralized with treasuries). 

T-Account:
Fed - 
DR reserve liability (reduces liability)
CR Repo liability (increases liability)

Commercial bank - 
DR RRP loan asset (collateral
