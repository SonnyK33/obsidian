There may be a strong connection between TGA balances and risk asset performance. When TGA balances increase, the Treasury is borrowing money and taking liquidity out of the system which could be used to purchase asstes. When TGA balances draw down, the treasury is spending money and stimulating the economy. In Q4'22, the TGA was steady as it couldn't borrow more due to debt ceiling negotiations. The TGA balance is now close to $400bn which could be close to a floor (per Yellen comments). The lack of TGA borrowing neutralized the impact of Fed quantitative tightening. That is, the Treasury wasn't issuing new securities to refinance maturing treasuries.

The RRP spiked in December. This indicates that MMFs are not withdrawing from the RRP to purchase treasuries. Instead they're being purchased by households who are using bank deposits and hence decreasing banking system liquidity. The implication from both of these facts is that the effects of QT haven't been realized yet and that it will be difficult to execute without hurting banking system liquidity. 

What is the impact of having this trapped liquidity? I think the main one is that there is an overhang of liquidity in the market. There is an implicit ceiling on treasury yields; above a certain level, MMFs will draw down their RRP facilities and switch to treasuries. This inflow into treasuries would be analogous to QE.

Managed care providers focused on government sponsored plans (like Centene) work under a capitation fee model. They collect a set amount per patient from the state. In turn they pay providers for all services convered under the plan. This is in contrast to a fee for service model where the state directly pays providers. The point of managed care is to disincentivize unnecessary care. In theory, they also provide preventitive care and other resources. 
#CNC may be a good upgrade candidate. They recently won new contracts for medicaid in LA  (this was a loss for #MOH)

Does the MC model save money for states?
