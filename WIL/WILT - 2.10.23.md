Africa Finance Corporation is a Nigerian development bank masquerading as a supra-national bank. Its 92% owned by Nigerian entities, but that remainig 8% allows Moody's to rate it as a supranational bank. That's how it can avoid the sovereign ceiling and get a single-A rating despite Nigeria's rating of B-/CCC.
