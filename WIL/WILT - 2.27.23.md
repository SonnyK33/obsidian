Argentine candidates are starting to position themselves for the primaries. Candidates for the governing coalition are unclear so far. It's unlikely Kirchener would run again given she didn't run last time when the economy was doing better.
Sergio Massa (the current econ minister) may run as the macro situation hasn't gotten worse. Whether he'll run with surging inflation is the question. How much does inflation matter to the average individual? Much of the impact is softened with fiscal subdidies. Inflation has gone from 50% in 2019 to ~100% now, but real incomes are about flat. A government popularity index run by
Torcuato Di Tella University (UTDT) is a good predictor of incumbent results. Incumbents only got >50% of the vote when the index was above 2.5. It's currently close to 1.0 which would point to getting 30% of the vote.
