Transitory Disinflation - Fed Guy
Wang argues that recent disinflation is from supply chain easing and rising labour force participation due to higher wages. Both of these are coming to their limit. That, plus the recent Fed pivot, fiscal stimulus, and higher interest rates, has increased purchasing power. The recent decrease in mortgage rates will increase real estate values which is broad based. All of this suggests that disinflation may not meet the 2% target, as the market is suggested.
