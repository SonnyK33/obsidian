**SVB, CS, and the Regionals**
This big story this week is the banking crisis in the US and Europe.  Regional banks in the US are suffering deposit withdrawals, and two (SVB and SBNY) were taken into receivership. A third, FRC, appears to have been temporarily rescued by $30bn in new deposits from large US banks. US authorities blinked when they agreed to insure all deposits at SVB and SBNY. They have this authority when a bank fails, but it's supposed to be reserved for systemic banks, which these clearly aren't. There have been criticisms from Europe that the US abandoned the playbook for failed banks that it helped to write. Although the US authorities have been vocal that no one below deposits will get bailed out, it is probable that bondholders will see some recovery. And why shouldn't they? Per the law, they're unsecured just as uninsured deposits are. 

The Fed's bailout of uinsured deposits allow banks to borrow par against their treasuries and Agency MBS. That is, despite the mark-to-market losses these notes have taken, their collateral value will be par for this fed facility. So it's wrong to say this won't cost the taxpayers anything. It effectively means money printing to bail out uninsured depositors. This action also increases the money-ness of these discount bonds and the amount of liquidity in the system. 

Post the bailout of SVB, deposits are flowing out of regional banks and into the large systemic banks. Counter-intuitively, more deposits may mean more bond issuance from these banks. More deposits will allow for (and require for margin purposes) more lending. That will increase RWA, and require more TLAC (total loss absorbing capital). TLAC consists of tier 1 capital, sub debt, and some senior bonds (>1 year maturity). So while unsecured bonds are used for funding, they're also needed for regulatory capital purposes. More deposits will require more issuance. 

Across the Atlantic, CS is imploding. Interestingly, the Swiss National Bank hasn't capitualted yet. Unlike the US with SVB. This echoes an earlier point from El Arian when he compared the UK's response to the SVB sub to that of the US. Outside the US, authorities aren't willing to risk moral hazard to maintain financial stability. 

**US/Russia**
The latest Hersh piece mentioned a story I had never heard of. The US desire to prervent the Soviet Union from exporting hydrocarbons to Europe goes back to the 1960s. Kennedy initially tried to stop a pipleline from Siberia from being built. Later in the 1980's, Reagan asked West Germany and France to abandon plans to lend money to Russia for the pipeline. They refused. Reagan responded by secondary sanctions on companies involved in the construction. The US' bombing of the Nord Stream stems from this same desire to block Russia from using its natural resources for it's own purposes. Biden, when speaking to the Atlantic Council, claimed he wasn't against Russia exporting its oil but that it had to play by the rules. He said Russia couldn't "weaponize" energy or use it for foreign policy. I'm not sure what country would follow that rule. Would the US continue exporting LNG to countries opposed to its foreign policy. Obviously not. 

**China/Taiwan**
A piece I read today pointed out how Taiwan's entire electricity infrastructure is centralized to a few plants and is vulnerable to cyber attacks. The author argued that the US could conduct a false flag there in the summer when the elderly population would be hurt by the high temperatures. That would be used to turn the local population against China and set the stage for a referendum for independence. That would force China's hand and likely lead to a forced unification. That would give the US the pretext to intervene and support Taiwan. The author is arguing that the US is preparing for war with China to stop its rise and any threats to the dollar's dominance. I would agree with all of that it. The Russia/Ukraine strategy may very well be attempted in China as well. 

Executing this strategy in China will be much harder however. The US wouldn't institute a draft to fight China but would rely on proxy states (especially Japan and others in SE Asia), as it's done with Ukraine. I think it would be hard to get partner countries in the region to commit troops. Unlike Ukrainians, they won't be as eager to fight a war with a superpower who isn't threatening them. The Japanese military and business elite may be in favour of ramping up defense spending, but I doubt the population wants to   Global South countries (India, Brazil, etc.) would also be dead set against it. A large portion of the German population is against sending weapons to Ukraine and would surely be against war with China. 

Isolating China would also require Europe, Australia, and others to support trade sanctions on China. However, it's likely that US and its partners will want to trade with China right up until the end due to competition amongst themselves. No members of the alliance would want to abandon the Chinese market, unless they can be sure others will as well. The US also needs China for key goods in its supply chain, including weapons. 

This doesn't mean that the US isn't preparing for war with China-- it clearly is. But it's not a straight line from here to there. 

**Personal Trading**
I lost money this week trading Nasdaq futures. I've done this too many times. My mistakes can be divided into:
1) Getting in to the trade too late and not thinking about why it was trading where it was. Stupid as it sounds, Nasdaq was rallying because financial contagion would mean lower rates. That argument is stupid because lower rates are occurring because of a disaster. Nevertheless, if I was going to fold after losing $3k, then I shouldn't have put it on. While the price seems to make no sense, why was it going to change so quickly? I should've anticipated the scenario where it gets more irrational before it doesn't. I need to think about stop losses and at what point I'd admit I'm wrong. If I had waited longer, there were better levels to cover. But ex-ante, it made sense to cover because it was clear I had no view, and it rallied further. But I wasted $3k because I didn't think through where my pain point is. What I did was pure gambling. Just do the easy trades. 
2) Getting the trade right and then capitulating when it retraces. This is partially the same issue. Is this a long-term trade or following a trend. If it's the latter, take some profits as trend weakens or reverses. If it's long-term, stops should be wide. 

The loss you'd take if the stop was hit should be the carry. That's the carry you're willing to pay for asymmetric gains. For now on, write each of these trades down with upside/downside.

If I don't have the conviction, just sit in treasuries.
