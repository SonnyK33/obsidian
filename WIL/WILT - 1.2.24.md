Chinese Iron Ore/Steel
https://www.ft.com/content/3d8a489e-3409-4748-a41a-46083a3051e0?shareType=nongift

China is the largest buyer of iron ore, and housing has been the main source of demand for steel. Though the housing market has contracted by double digits the past couple of years, iron ore imports have remained strong. This could be due to hope around on Chinese stimulus. However, reported statistics show falling Chinese steel production which makes sense, as they're likely losing money on current iron ore and coal pries. One explanation is that actual steel production is higher, and is going into exports to SE Asia.
