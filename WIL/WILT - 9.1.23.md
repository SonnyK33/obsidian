Stock and flow model for consumer spending. 

Creditors' asset value is a function of invested capital which is the stock. Outflows are dividends and interest expense. Inflows are EBIT from consumers. Interest expense is being driven by central banks. EBIT is being driven by consumer wages which is also affecting central banks. For credits with floating rate debt, they need EBIT to rise faster than interestÂ rates. This implies wages need to grow faster than interest rates. There's various adjustments that need to be made to this. In a weak economy, even if wages increase, consumers may choose to save more, or at least spend less on discretionary items. The portion of debt that's floating also matters. The quantity of consumers also matters. So if volumes are down 10%, and revenue needs to grow at 5%, prices need to increase by ~15%. That means either wages increase 15% or they overspend in this category.

Along with wage increases, opex is also rising, and is linked to the same cycle as revenue.
