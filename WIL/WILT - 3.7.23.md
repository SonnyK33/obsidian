Chinese companies are listing in Switzerland over NY or London.
GS credit strats likes long credit and short rates. Their argument is that the main risk for credit is rates, and so that's covered by the hedge. Fundamentals aren't great but aren't deteriorating quickly, and most have liquidity. I don't really agree on the first one, but I don't think we're about to see a wave of default. They like the carry in a high inflation, slow growth world. I don't think the levels back this argument; Main CDX is at spring '22 levels. What they're saying is in the price. They like compression and steepeners. I like short 1st liens/secured vs unsecured in certain cap structures, but it's situation dependent. 

For most current use cases, cable or FWA suffices. Speeds enabled by fiber are only needed for multiple people streaming 4K video at the same time. Cable upgrades and FWA is much cheaper than fiber to deploy.
