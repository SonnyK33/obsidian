The DTC business has been loss making for media companies (DIS, WBD, PARA, etc). They've disintermediated the cable companies, from where they actually derive most of their profits. I don't think that was ever true for consumer products. DTC is likely more profitable for manufacturers who don't have to share profits with department stores. When does DTC work? What are previous examples?
