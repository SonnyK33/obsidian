There are a few African development banks which have material exposure to HY sovereign credits in the region. Strangely, they're IG rated and benefit from a strange ratings methodology which allows them to have a better rating than their shareholders or borrowers. 

Gabon is CCC rated and has some near term maturities. 

Sy Hersh came out with a detailed report claiming the US blew up the nord stream pipeline. One aspect of this story that was new to me was the NATO head's (Jens Stoltenberg) strong and old ties with the US. Hersh alleges Norweigan divers helped the US. The one thing hersh doesn't do a great job of explaining is why Sholtz went along with this, and what was done to get him on their side. I also hadn't thought of Norway's interest in selling gas to Germany.
