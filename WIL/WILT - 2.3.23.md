I shorted futures as soon as the hot job numbers came in. They were much stronger than expected and pushed the unemployment rate to a 50 year low. Given how well the market's been the past few days, I thought a sell-off would be triggered by the news. At first it worked, but then the market started to come back. At 10:30, ISM numbers came in much stronger than expected. This fits with the goldilocks scenario. Jobs are strong, consumer spending is strong, and inflation is weakening. Inflation will be a problem - yes, but the market isn't worried about that yet. As of 2:40, S&P is selling off again and is almost back to where I initially shorted it. 

I was happy that I covered when I did (after the ISM numbers) and took my small loss, given that they rallied another 30 points. The easier and much more asymmetric trade would have been to just short IEF. Short-term rates will have to sell off if the market is going to rally on strong jobs. That just means rates will stay higher for longer.
