China is the only bullish story right now. I was clearly wrong to sell my KWEB stock at the end of Dec. I was right to monetize, but should've moved some of the gains into OTM calls as price appreication past $30 was binary. $30 was a clear resistance level and it was either going to partially retrace or spike.  Fed minutes were hawkish and make clear that labour force participation is a real problem. I was right to not sell WBD in Dec and was probably correct that the sell-off in Dec was due to holders taking the tax loss. Gold and rates have continued to rally showing that the recession narrative is now consensus. However, stocks have held steady and are slightly up for the year. 

TGA issue may not get resolved yet as delays around the House speaker election could delay debt ceiling votes. This is short-term positive for risk assets. 

I spoke to MS' analyst on CNC. There isn't a near-term catalyst but it's worth keeping on the radar. If state budgets come under pressure, managed care GSE plans could become more appealing. 



Narrative
Like yesterday, rates and gold are up, oil is down. All three fit with recession theme. Higher gold makes sense in a recession followed by a pivot. China continues to rally which could just be because people need to buy something, and it still looks cheap.

**Predictions**
1) China
Previous belief - 
I sold KWEB too early as I thought narrative around covid surge and possible delayed reopening would cause profit taking.

Update to priors - 
a) Public pressure on Xi was too great, and he realized he had to fully reopen. Constraints do matter here. 
b) There needs to be something to buy. This is the only bullish story out there. 

Trade Review
a) I should've switched from spot to a call. After indices were up 30%+, it should have been clear that they would pop a lot higher (as were still cheap) or retrace half way. KWEB consolidated around $30; there was clear support there. Moving to a slightly OTM call would have made sense. At first, spot made sense because timing may have taken longer than anticipated. 



1 goal
Centene view
- will mention, but not that interesting
- maybe 20 bps for 5yr, and no obvious catalyst

*Macro*
There was a substantial decrease in liquidity in the US and ECB in December. In the US, this was partially offset by a TGA declines due to debt ceiling issues. Debt ceiling issue still hasn't been solved and could be delayed by House speaker election. That's a net positive for risk assets. G10 liquidity which correlates with commodities is up thanks to China. Lower inflation prints plus China reopening plus still strong labour market is likely good for risk assets in the medium term. This may lead to premature loosening which will reignite inflation worries, but that's not happening yet. EM will do better with a stronger China and may see some early loosening in places like Brazil.
