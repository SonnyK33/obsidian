WILT
Martin Wolf points out that, while Indian savings rates are below China's, they're higher than most developing countries. At 30%, they exceed Turkey, Mexico, and Brazil; they're below China and Indonesia. The Brazil number is likely outdated (it has a current account surplus now), Mexico benefits from NAFTA, and Turkey is probably not a good comparable. Its GDP per capita is 4x that of India, and its currency is clearly overvalued.

Wolf doesn't address how India will achieve the 5% growth rate he forecasts without providing adequate jobs however. Mody's point was that no developing country has succeeded without creating low-skilled jobs, which primarily come from the manufacturing sector. 

Bollywood vs IPL
An article from Ruchir Sharma contrasts bollywood with cricket, and argues that the former has failed to adapt to the times, while the IPL has brought cricket into the 21st century. Bollywood is targeted to Hindi speakers (and now underperforms many regional industries), and concentrates most of the gains with the ageing stars. The new cricket league is broadcast in multiple languages, shortened the games, and has "modernized" the viewing experience. There are cheerleaders, and viewers can alter the viewing angle from streamers. Bollywood's box office is down 50% from 2019, much worse than the US. Most of the best releases now come to streamers rather than theatres.
