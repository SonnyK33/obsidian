Egyptian real wages are down 70% since the  Egyptian revolution in 2011. Anecdotally, they're the most unhappy they've been in that period. The IMF did not give them a generous deal and knows that structural reforms, especially a weaker currency, are not tested. The government's most important objective is maintaining social stability. People may be reluctant to come to the streets at first due to the opressive government. However, it was unthinkable that Mubarak would get thrown out like he was in 2011. The backdrop is different this time (no Arab Spring), but the macro situation is much worse. There's still a large funding gap this year. 

Peru is *cutting* rates due to mass protests and road blockages. The country has been in turmoil since the previous president (Castillo) was arrested and replaced. This is a complex story, but hightlights how tough things are for emerging markets right now. Rather than loosening policy in response to a crisis, they actually have to tighten. Protests have stopped traffic and the supply goods around the country. Peru's inflation of 8% makes cutting rates impossible. 

*Debt Limit*
Sec yellen projected that the limit will be breached in January. TGA is already below $400bn and they don't want it to go any lower. Tax receipts are also likely to be low due to low capital gains. This may be good for risk versus in strong years and people have to sell stocks to pay their taxes.

I made some good calls at the end of the year but I traded incorrectly. Coinbase stock sold off into year end, and I bought a little. The story is tough, but it looked too cheap, especially with talks of a soft landing. I also thought a bullish consensus on gold would be good for bitcoin and Coinbase. I was afraid to buy in size because I'm still bearish on risk assets. Like WBD, I suspected there was tax loss selling in December. Rather than buying an insignificant amount of stock, I should've bought calls. That's true for WBD as well. When you're scared to buy in size but think you're close to an inflection point because something is oversold, you should be buying calls not spot. There was a strong bearish technical at year end (tax loss selling). This was the perfect setup for calls. Simplying buying short-dated calls/puts on equities that  are oversold/overbought is probably a decent strategy. META was another good candidate for January calls. 

Eurodollar market is pricing in a 1.1% probability of rates being above 5% by December. That is, it's pricing in a 99% chance of a recession, since that's the only realistic scenario where the Fed will be cutting. 

*Funding Costs cont'd*
Decompression starting to look more interesting. More specific catalysts in CCC's and not being paid to take BB or single-B risk. Decompression in long skew which seems like the right way to be positioned. Given the market is expecting a soft landing (ED markets pricing in a very small probability of rates being above 5% at yearend).

Narrative
The market is finally taking a breather after a very strong start to the year. Stocks are down, but so are treasuries, as soft landing getting priced in. Gold is also up which makes sense if you're expecting a soft landing and a pivot.
