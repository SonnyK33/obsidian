Gas prices could be much higher next year when export facilities come online. The current glut is due to gas in storage, in anticipation of exports. When LNG terminals come in line-- especially Plaquemines-- that storage should get unwound, and the market could go from surplus to deficit quickly. That was what was behind the lobby to stop issuing export permits.

In the UK, homeowners can't ordinarily pre-pay mortgages. It's the same in Canada. In a high rate environment, it makes sense for homeowners to get short-term mortgages so they're not locked into high rates. In the US, that's not a fear, as you can refinance if rates come down.
