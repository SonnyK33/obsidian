Upload speeds are important for those working from home, using videoconferencing services. I've been looking at Altice a cable company focused on the greater NY area. They've been bleeding subscribers. Though they've been investing a lot into fiber, most users in NYC only have access to cable. While cable speeds are comparable to fiber for downloads, it can't compete with fiber for uploads. It will be hard to compete with Verizon without deploying more fiber.
