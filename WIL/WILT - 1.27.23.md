The Fed uses core PCE ex-housing rents, not CPI as its inflation guage. Core PCE hasn't been decreasing the way CPI has. The sharp slow down in CPI is driven by a methodological difference in medical care insurance. Core PCE has barely dcreased. It rose 0.3% in Dec, the same as the prior period. This is 4% annually versus 2% pre-covid. 

Bloomberg is modeling 3% inflation in late-'23 - early '24. The last 100 bps of disinflation will be tough as will be operating in the flat part of the Philips curve. Bloomberg estimates it would take 3pp increase in unemployment to get there. 

The rates market is still forecasting a 50 bps cut by year-end. That only happens in a depression or miracle. 

CPI uses a strange methodology for health care insurance. It looks at the earnings of insurance companies as a proxy. Data is also lagged by almost a year. During 2020 utilization of medical services was low and so profits were high. This was taken to mean higher premnium inflation. Data is also lagged by 10 months, so the decline in utilization in early 2020 showed up by early 2021.
