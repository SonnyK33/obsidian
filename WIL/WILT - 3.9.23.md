One of the causes of the Mexican "Tequila Crisis" in 1994 was a lower appetite for risk assets in the US, in part caused by a slowdown in flows from Japan to the US. An interesting parallel to today where flows from Japan are likely to decrease given higher JGB yields. Most peopl focus on Mexican fiscal and monetary policy during that period and the government's decision to abandon the peg. But earlier in the year, the Mexican central bank was actually intervening to prevent appreciation. Investors were excited for the prospects of the Mexican economy given the newly enacted NAFTA. What changed were capital flows from the US, in part caused by Japan. Incidentally, in February Japan bought the most foreign bonds in two years. After, being a net seller in 2022, they bought JPY 4tr ($30bn) in February

The best political stories may actually be the best shorts. They attract the most inflows and make the local economy vulnerable to reversals.
