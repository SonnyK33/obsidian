WILT
SBNY, the crypto-focused bank, that collapsed along with SIVB in March, may have residual value, possibly through the equity. It failed due to a run on deposits, led by crypto-focused businesses. It's now in FDIC receivership, and its assets are being sold to pay off depositors. From our initial look, there may be assets in excess of liabilities, implying value for the subordinate bonds, and possibly the equity. The bonds are now trading in the 20s, and the stock has a $10m market cap. Its assets included commercial real estate, as well as loans to PE funds, which should be worth par. The FDIC already has a rather stringent loan loss reserve on the assets (~$6bn). If it's only say, 5bn, that would imply a $800m market cap (80x upside). 

HY Opportunity 2024
1) Get all HY cash bonds and group by sector
2) Filter out immaterial bonds
3) Get duration and spreads for each cusip, and then get weighted averages for each sector
4) What are questions/themes/issues for each sector
5) Where would spreads go in bear/bull cases corresponding to relevant questions
6) What is upside/downside for each sector, based on those cases
7) That should give opportunity size
8) Trade types - thematic (based on these questions), new deals (including reverses), and opportunistic (event-driven based on newsflow, corporate actions, etc)
	1) Thematic - based on above opportunity sizing
	2)  What are potential new issues?
	3) Opportunistic are hard to predict ahead of time

The goal is to have an entire trading strategy for 2024 ready. What are the relevant timelines for the different sectors?
1) what deals should we be reversing for?
2) what secured deals could be interesting?
3) which equities should we own?

AMC
We knew why it was trading where it was. The company could continue issuing stock to buyback the second liens. That should've led us to shorting the equity. How would AMC fit in the management incentive framework? With no near term maturities, they are incentivized to increase volatility. They didn't really do that by issuing stock though. This was a unique example, where the equity markets continued to support the company. They've also been okay killing the equity in the short-term, just to keep the company alive.
