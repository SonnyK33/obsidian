The latest debt exchange, while solving short-term liquidity issues, won't solve overall solvency issues which will reappear in two years. As debt on the PIK notes accrues, the interest burden will be worse than it is right now. The only way forward is for units to increase by 25% in the next two years.

Management announced that they were cutting capex to preserve FCF. In my framework, this decreases FCF volatility and increases equity and debt value. This is obvious. What's important is to notice how management's objectives change. When asset values are high relative to debt, it makes sense to increase volatility to enhance equity value (which offsets the decrease in asset value). When the equity is close to being out-of-the-money however, it makes sense to decrease volatility, in order to increase the value of the underlying. When the equity (call on assets) is close to ATM, gamma and vega are their maximum. Management will often find it advantageous here to increase the value of the underlying rather than volatility.

This seems different from "normal" call options. When management engages in pro-shareholder activities, it often increases volatility which offsets the decrease in value of the underlying and results in a net increase in the option. In most markets, the decrease in intrinsic value hurts you more than the volatility helps you. This means skew is upward sloping. As volatility increases, the asset value decreases, pushing the option further out of the money. If this results in a more valuable option, skew is upward sloping. What are the implications of this? What causes this skew to change?

When a company is near bankruptcy, it makes sense to decrease the probability of bankruptcy and decrease the volatility of the underlying assets. If the resulting increase in asset value offsets the impact of lower volatility, the skew is now downward sloping.

Also if a company is having liquidity issues due to near term debt maturities, the expiry on the equity call option is coming up. While Vega is at maximum for ATM options, it declines as options near expiry. On that basis, there's much more value in trying to increase the underlying's value then the option's expiry. This makes equity call options different from vanilla options. In this example, management can decrease the underlying's volatility, which increases the underlying's value, AND postpones the expiry on the equity call option. As the time to expire increases, vega increases and gamma decreases. As such, it makes sense to increase volatility, at the expense of the underlying, once you've bought time.
