A lot of HY deals are coming with OIDs. The market is demanding a certain yield, but issuers can't afford that much interest expense.  They reconcile this by issuing bonds  below par. But they're borrowing par, and that will have to be repaid in 5-8 years. This indicates that a good portion of the HY universe simply doesn't work at these rates. Few credits can pay 12% interest, and so they issue at 10% with an OID. The question is if the use of proceeds will allow them to generate high enough returns to pay back par. 


Turkish economist said Turkey will need $15bn from external sources to pay for the fiscal expansion needed to offset the monetary contraction. Where will that come from? Saudis have been reluctant, and the UAE is only doing so through energy projects. All of a sudden there a lot of countries who don't to park their reserves in US treasuries. 

Barry Eichengreen, said that if China reduces its treasury holdings, that won't necessarily translate to lower deficits in the US (as Pettis argues). I think this point was that China (and Saudi and others whose foreign policies goals are shifting) can deploy funds elsewhere - developing countries, BRI, etc. Foreign investment has broadened, and so it's isn't so clear-cut anymore. 

I read a piece by MMT economist Fullwiller which ties together some BoP arguments with MMT thinking. It was written in the context planned fiscal austerity in 2011. 

Using the familiar equation - 
M - X = (I - S) -Â (T - G)
They arrange it as:

Current Account Balance = Domestic Private Savings + Budget Surplus
Private Savings = CA Balance + Budget Deficit

His point is that if the deficit is decreased, assuming the the current account balance doesn't improve (which would coincide with a smaller capital account surplus), private savings must decrease. As has been argued by [[Trade Wars are Class Wars]] and [[Bernanke on Savings Glut]], the trade deficit is at least partially driven by the world's excess savings coming into the US. Lower inflows from the net savers though would change the math. A lower current account deficit would allow for either more private savings, or a lower budget deficit. If the deficit is expanded while the current account deficit decreases, private savings will have to increase by a lot (consumption will have to decrease). That means the domestic consumer will be squeezed. 



A decrease in private savings is the same as leveraging. Negative savings are also associated with economic fragility and asset bubbles. [[Bernanke on Savings Glut]] discusses this. Fullwiller argues that a decrease in private savings may actually not occur. Households will react to fiscal austerity by reducing their savings as well, hence leading to lower overall output (GDP) and lower tax receipts. Thus the fiscal balance is "endogenous" to the public's reaction. It's circular. The less the government spends, the less the public spends -- a reinforcing loop in [[Thinking in Systems - WIP]] jargon. 

Read a good piece by Damodaran summarizing the current media/streamer/cable conflict. Most of it was a summary of what's known, but I had two takeaways:
1) This is somewhat a replay of what happened to the music business with the advent of streamers there. The impact of disruption there has been the death of music stores (theatres?), consolidation (WBD, PARA), and lower overall revenues (DIS). What's different is that the incumbents themselves are disrupting their traditional businesses. While that's better than going bankrupt (like legacy music studios did - Motown for example), there will be a tough transition period. Also during this interim period, complementary companies (like cable) can't be cut out because they're also disrupting themselves by expanding into broadband.
2) When looking at an ecosystem like this, it may be possible to glean what the market is thinking by looking at different players and their valuation. NFLX valuation is implying that the market thinks they can reduce content spend without losing too many subscribers. DIS' value is implying uncertainty during this transition period.

I need a good framework for thinking of these different players and their changing dynamics. [[Thinking in Systems - WIP]] could provide some tools. 

**Merton model spreads and stocks/flows**
Credit spreads are the premium you receive for selling a put on the firm's assets. You're getting paid for taking the (non-linear) risk that the asset value won't fall below the debt value. If using a stock and flow model where the relevant stocks are debt and assets, and the relevant flows are EBIT (net inflows) and interest expense (outflows), what does that spread represent?

If inflows < outflows, the asset will decrease. The market value of the asset will differ from this value, but it should be directionally correct. Holding all else equal (market multiples, management skill at deploying capex effectively, etc), if the rate of inflows is lower than the rate of outflows, the asset will deplete in value. 

I think of spreads as a function of how variable the outcomes are. That is, given the option pricing model, the volatility of returns is the most important metric. The rest of the drivers are known and generally priced in correctly. In the stock/flows model, variability of outcomes is driven by some combination of variability of inflows and/or outflows. The stock (asset base less face value of debt corresponding to the tranche) is the buffer and will slow the impact in either direction. 

The DTC business has been loss making for media companies (DIS, WBD, PARA, etc). They've disintermediated the cable companies, from where they actually derive most of their profits. I don't think that was ever true for consumer products. DTC is likely more profitable for manufacturers who don't have to share profits with department stores. When does DTC work? What are previous examples?

**Fiber Spend**
Subsidies for fiber buildout from the IRA were thought to be supportive of telco operators. However, it may encourage capex in some areas where the target population is poorer and less willing to pay high ARPUs. This will be most negative for FYBR and LUMEN. The policy's split between FWA and fiber is also not clear. FWA scores well with businesses, which poses a threat to enterprise fiber products, like those offered by Lumen. It's also a lower price point and many SMB's have lighter data needs (e.g. no video streaming). 

The funding from the IRA (BEAD) is also increasing labour costs in the industry and increasing the per home cost of fiber. 

**Pakistan**
Delays in the coming election may go beyond the 2024 bond maturity. That may increase the pressure to pay it off. However, given the deteriorating fiscal regime, it could hurt debt sustainability. The country has been financing itself with short-term local debt and floaters. While that takes pressure off reserves, it means that fiscal deficits will continue. The high local yields (>20%) resulting from the fiscal trajectory has crowded out private investment. 

**Stocks and Flows - Pettis on Treasures**
I previously rationalized the argument that fewer foreign purchases of treasuries may actually coincide with a lower supply, and hence won't lead to higher yields. The logic is that fewer purchases of treasuries implies a lower current account deficit in the US. That implies a higher savings rate, which means some combination of more private savings or a lower budget deficit. Because the US isn't capital starved, the foreign savings being dumped in the US right now are not increasing investment, but rather depressing savings. This manifests through higher unemployment (a weaker export sector), or fiscal deficits. Hence, a reversal in these flows should result in lower fiscal deficits and higher private savings. This means lower treasury issuance. Pettis' argument is hence that fewer foreign purchases of treasuries won't lead to higher yields. 

There are a few flaws in this reasoning. First, he's obviously assuming that other variables don't change as this shock works through the balance of payments. But a stronger export sector and more tax revenue could be matched by more fiscal spending. That seems to be almost obvious. There will be pushes for tax cuts and military spending from the right and social spending from the left. Second, there's the issue of timing. One insight from [[Thinking in Systems - WIP]] has been that flows respond to stocks not other flows. Stocks also serve as buffers and delay the response function. While Pettis' logic may be right, it will take a while to work through the system. He's also been arguing for a slowdown in China due to its imbalances for many years. His chain of reasoning is right and in relies on accounting identities, but it can take a long time for those imbalances to reverse.

Fiscal deficits will respond to the level of unemployment and tax revenue (among other things). Employment patterns won't change over night even with more export revenue in the manufacturing sector. Higher profits for exporters won't instantly translate to higher wages, even with stronger labour unions. 

What are the stocks and flows in the balance of payments argument?
*Stocks*
Treasury Holdings
Domestic Savings

*Flows*
Foreign purchases (outflow for the US, inflow for rest of world)
Treasury issuance (inflow for the US)
Net US exports - the mirror image of foreign purchases 

Treasury issuance -> US holdings -> Foreign holdings 


**Credits with EBIT < Interest**
Looking at VSCO whose interest expense is nearly equal to EBIT. Interest is an outflow and is a function of capital markets. Higher profitability should lead to higher rates. That's the balancing loop. EBIT are inflows of capital and come from the consumer. Consumer spending is a renewable resource which growth with wages and economic growth--- the same loop that drives interest rates. If people spend too much on consumption, they'll have less money to invest, which reduces the potential of the wealth effect. VSCO's asset value is a function of invested capital which is a function of these two loops. If rates increase faster than consumption (driven by wages and beliefs about future wealth appreciation), the asset will deplete over time. What's growing faster - interest rates or consumption?
