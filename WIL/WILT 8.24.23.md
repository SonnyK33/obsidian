Breaking down national income accounting again. 
Income approach:
Y = C + I + G + (X-M)

Expenditure approach:
Y = C + S + T

C + I + G + (X-M) = C + S + T
I + G + NX = S + T
(S - I) + (T-G) = NX

Pettis argues that higher capital inflows will lower interest rates only when investment needs are constrained by scarce savings. When the capital surplus is higher, NX is lower, so either private savings go down (S-I) or government surplus goes down (T-G) or both. If investment had been constrained prior to the capital inflows, Investment will increase by more than Savings, and (T-G) may remain unchanged. That is, treasury issuance may be unchanged. If investment is not constrained by savings though, higher inflows will just cause lower savings (see [[US Trade Policy]]). It will do this by: making consumption more expensive (higher exchange rate), higher unemployment, and/or higher government deficits. This will result in more issuance. So The capital inflows actually led to more treasury issuance, and hence wouldn't cause higher yields.
