**Panama/First Quantum**
The Panamanian Supreme Court ruled against the FMCN concession. The key question to me is why they ruled against the deal, not why the protests are happening. Apparently, they ruled against the concession partially because of a previous ruling for another mine. It's not about the royalty amount. This is important because it means our base case shouldn't just be a contract with higher royalties.

I'm going through this new credit and will follow the framework to see how well it fares. 


2.       Are their liquidity issues? If so, make quick FCF model w/ scenarios around key risks and look at front-end bonds
	- $625m of liquidity
	- $3.1bn due in 2026
	- Consensus FCF for 2024 and 2025 is $450m each so they'll have $1.5bn by 2026
	a.       What are their options?
		- an uptiering or drop-down transaction is possible 

Can stop the checklist here. The next step is a basic FCF model where I can sensitize digital and terrestrial ad spend. Is there a a new deal which would be interesting? I also need to look at the rest of the space, which in this case is just Cumulus I believe, and put the credit in the broader context.
