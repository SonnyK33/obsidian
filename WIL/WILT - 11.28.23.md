**Panama/First Quantum**
The Panamanian Supreme Court ruled against the FMCN concession. The key question to me is why they ruled against the deal, not why the protests are happening. Apparently, they ruled against the concession partially because of a previous ruling for another mine. It's not about the royalty amount. This is important because it means our base case shouldn't just be a contract with higher royalties.

I'm going through this new credit and will follow the framework to see how well it fares. 


2.       Are their liquidity issues? If so, make quick FCF model w/ scenarios around key risks and look at front-end bonds
	- $625m of liquidity
	- $3.1bn due in 2026
	- Consensus FCF for 2024 and 2025 is $450m each so they'll have $1.5bn by 2026
	a.       What are their options?
		- an uptiering or drop-down transaction is possible 
		- 

3.       If not, where will leverage go under different topline scenarios?

4.       What scenario are bonds pricing in? If that scenario is a reasonable case, there’s nothing to do

5.       If there are reasonable alternate scenarios, write out quick investment thesis – which should identify:

a.        risks/catalysts

b.       Upside/downside on securities

c.       Likely issuer in future? When will they be issuing? How much? Structure, and what level would make sense? Reverse?

6.       Schedule call if diligence questions and/or if likely issuer
