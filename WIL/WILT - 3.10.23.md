	Banks are selling off in the US and Europe after liquidity issues emerged at SVB. Banks have taken paper losses on treasury holdings which don't affect P&L. Since the Global Financial Crisis, banks have increased treasury holdings per Basel requirements. While banks don't have to show losses on treasuries if they're held to maturity, a large deposit outflow could force sales and losses. This, plus the decline in bank reserves from QT, will pressure bank liqudity and credit growth. 
	Non-farm payrolls came in above expecations, but unemployment and LFR were up. So the pace of people entering the job force slightly exceeded job creation. The market likes this, and futures reversed gains. The market is no longer pricing in 50bps for the next rate increase. Wages are still rising 4-5%, which is too high for a 2% inflation target, but is being offset by fewer hours being worked. This seems consistent with an economy where employers are scared to lay people off, due to a scarcity of workers, but there's less work to do.
