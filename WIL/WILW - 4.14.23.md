**Egypt**
I've been bearish on Egypt for some time now due to high funding needs (current account and debt amortizations), and it's inability to attract adequate aid from the IMF or its gulf partners. Egypt had been one of emerging world's largest beneficiaries of capital flows, and now that liquidity is going in the other direction, that is reversing. Incidentally the other major beneficiary was Ukraine, who may have been going through its own debt crisis even without the war. 

Egypt's trade deficit is driven by low exports (10% of GDP vs 37% for GS' EM sample) not high imports. For Egypt, its main levers are to devalue the currency and to decrease the military's  involvement in the economy. The latter includes privatization of key assets and making the environment better for FDI. Important assets they're considering divesting include the United Bank and Telecom Egypt. Egypt's main imports (food, energy, etc) are inelastic and hence not adjusting with a weaker exchange rate. Exports haven't been boosted either, partially since many rely on key imports (especially raw materials).. High government spending (including defense and infrastructure) has added pressure to the current account. That's because fiscal spending crowds out private investment and hurts exports. It raises local interest rates and discourages FDI. 

The current account can also be thought of as the difference between savings and investment. Excess savings (S>I) will create a current account surplus and capital account deficit (purchases foreign assets). Chronic periods of savings below investment require the ability to export capital (sell treasuries to foreign investors). A "sudden stop" would require Egypt to either cut the current account (external adjustment - by depreciating the exchange rate) or repress domestic demand (internal adjustment - lowering economic growth and public spending).

I've been reading work by economist Michael Pettis lately. He does a very good of explaining balance of payment flows from first principles and the implicit tradeoffs a state must make. His book "Volatility Machine" specifically addresses debt crises in developing economies. The book's main argument is that emerging markets don't run into trouble because of poor economic policies but rather capital structures which create death spirals. Short-term FX debt becomes more expensive to service just as the local economy is weakening. This is clearly the case with Egypt. Emerging markets are also (by definition) driven primarily by global liquidity flows. During the good times, capital poured into Egypt due to attractive yields and a good story. As rates have gone up globally, this trend is reversing.
