Peru's crisis has worsened. 70%+ of Peruvians want new elections, but congress is refusing. A lef-wing bloc will only assent to elections if there are constitutional amendments. Peru is still BBB but has a negative outlook from all three agencies.  If it gets comped to Brazil or Colombia, there would be material widening. Long bonds could be down 20 pts. 

Pakistan is under financial distress and close to a default. One of the root causes is its high fertility rate. It's currently ~4 babies/mother, which is twice has high as what's needed to maintain the population. India and Bangladesh were able to reduce fertility with pro-women policies. High fertility increases the dependency ratio (children <15 + people >65 / working age poulation). The very young and old consume more and save less. Thus, a high dependency ratio leads to lower investment and savings and a higher current account deficit.  The curreny dependency ratio in Pakistan is 70% vs <50% in India and Bangladesh. 

Pakistan squandered the gains they got from the war on terror and the aid flows from the US. Instead of using the funds to restructure, they ran larger deficiits. I suspect that's partially because the aid flows benefited certain industries (e.g. defense) which were most connected with the country's elite. 

Pakistan also signed a free trade agreement with China in 2006. This has led to lopsided terms and  a large deficit for Pakistan vs China. This is odd given Pakistan's lower level of development versus that of China.
