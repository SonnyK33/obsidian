There may be a strong connection between TGA balances and risk asset performance. When TGA balances increase, the Treasury is borrowing money and taking liquidity out of the system which could be used to purchase asstes. When TGA balances draw down, the treasury is spending money and stimulating the economy. In Q4'22, the TGA was steady as it couldn't borrow more due to debt ceiling negotiations. The TGA balance is now close to $400bn which could be close to a floor (per Yellen comments). The lack of TGA borrowing neutralized the impact of Fed quantitative tightening. That is, the Treasury wasn't issuing new securities to refinance maturing treasuries.

The RRP spiked in December. This indicates that MMFs are not withdrawing from the RRP to purchase treasuries. Instead they're being purchased by households who are using bank deposits and hence decreasing banking system liquidity. The implication from both of these facts is that the effects of QT haven't been realized yet and that it will be difficult to execute without hurting banking system liquidity. 

What is the impact of having this trapped liquidity? I think the main one is that there is an overhang of liquidity in the market. There is an implicit ceiling on treasury yields; above a certain level, MMFs will draw down their RRP facilities and switch to treasuries. This inflow into treasuries would be analogous to QE.

Managed care providers focused on government sponsored plans (like Centene) work under a capitation fee model. They collect a set amount per patient from the state. In turn they pay providers for all services convered under the plan. This is in contrast to a fee for service model where the state directly pays providers. The point of managed care is to disincentivize unnecessary care. In theory, they also provide preventitive care and other resources. 
#CNC may be a good upgrade candidate. They recently won new contracts for medicaid in LA  (this was a loss for #MOH)

Does the MC model save money for states?

China is the only bullish story right now. I was clearly wrong to sell my KWEB stock at the end of Dec. I was right to monetize, but should've moved some of the gains into OTM calls as price appreication past $30 was binary. $30 was a clear resistance level and it was either going to partially retrace or spike.  Fed minutes were hawkish and make clear that labour force participation is a real problem. I was right to not sell WBD in Dec and was probably correct that the sell-off in Dec was due to holders taking the tax loss. Gold and rates have continued to rally showing that the recession narrative is now consensus. However, stocks have held steady and are slightly up for the year. 

TGA issue may not get resolved yet as delays around the House speaker election could delay debt ceiling votes. This is short-term positive for risk assets. 

I spoke to MS' analyst on CNC. There isn't a near-term catalyst but it's worth keeping on the radar. If state budgets come under pressure, managed care GSE plans could become more appealing. 



Narrative
Like yesterday, rates and gold are up, oil is down. All three fit with recession theme. Higher gold makes sense in a recession followed by a pivot. China continues to rally which could just be because people need to buy something, and it still looks cheap.

**Predictions**
1) China
Previous belief - 
I sold KWEB too early as I thought narrative around covid surge and possible delayed reopening would cause profit taking.

Update to priors - 
a) Public pressure on Xi was too great, and he realized he had to fully reopen. Constraints do matter here. 
b) There needs to be something to buy. This is the only bullish story out there. 

Trade Review
a) I should've switched from spot to a call. After indices were up 30%+, it should have been clear that they would pop a lot higher (as were still cheap) or retrace half way. KWEB consolidated around $30; there was clear support there. Moving to a slightly OTM call would have made sense. At first, spot made sense because timing may have taken longer than anticipated.

- will mention, but not that interesting
- maybe 20 bps for 5yr, and no obvious catalyst

There was a substantial decrease in liquidity in the US and ECB in December. In the US, this was partially offset by a TGA declines due to debt ceiling issues. Debt ceiling issue still hasn't been solved and could be delayed by House speaker election. That's a net positive for risk assets. G10 liquidity which correlates with commodities is up thanks to China. Lower inflation prints plus China reopening plus still strong labour market is likely good for risk assets in the medium term. This may lead to premature loosening which will reignite inflation worries, but that's not happening yet. EM will do better with a stronger China and may see some early loosening in places like Brazil.

Owning 10y treasuries are negative carry because of the inverted curve. Fed funds is higher than 10y yields. Shorting 10y treasuries is positive carry. So you're earning passive income for being short risk. The same is true for shorting high quality IG bonds. If you want to be long IG bonds, you either fully fund and pay negative carry or you allow your balance sheet to shrink. For a HY bond say earning 6%, your carry (with leverage) is getting close to zero, and so breakeven on price is much lower. There's a ~40bps spread between where we borrow and lend in repo markets. 

CLOs will be cutting their exposure to HY loans as they are close to hitting trigger points for maximum CCC and HY limits. Overall, there's much less money for risky assets. 

Narrative
ADP numbers came above expectations and jobless numbers below.  This fits with all of the Fed warnings that labour and wage growth is too strong, despite the higher rates. Will see profit taking in some of the moves over the past few days - gold is down as are rates. Chinese equities will likely be lower as well. There's a been a lot of IG supply this week, and pretty much every bond is lower.

Coal equities are very cheap, and Australian names will improve from thawing relations with China. China lifted bans on importing coal for some of its companies. That, plus easing of restrictions on HY property companies is part of the reopening story 

Narrative
Rates are off again as market anticipating a strong payrolls number after ADP and jobless claims were better than expected yesterday. Gold is similarly up and oil is down. Yesterday the Chinese government announced they were relaxing their three red lines policy which made it harder for distressed property companies to refinance debt. As has been the theme all week, the only positive story in the market is China which is the only major economy loosening policy. 

Payrolls blew threw estimates and the unemployment rate fell. The LPR in reased while unemployment decreased, so more people joined the market and found employment. Thje Fed has signalled it needs a 4.6% unemployment rate versus the current 3.5% (down from 3.6% in Dec).
