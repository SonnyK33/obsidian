Type: #WILT 

**Welcome to 2023**
The first week in 2023 shows the market needs something to get excited about after a difficult 2022. ADP numbers came above expectations and jobless numbers came below. The LPR increased while unemployment decreased. This means more people joined the market and were able to find employment. The Fed has signaled it needs a 4.6% unemployment rate versus the current 3.5% (down from 3.6% in Dec). This fits with the Fed warnings that labour and wage growth is too strong. Despite what this signals for markets, the S&P rallied hard on optimism that it may achieve a soft landing. 

The playbook for now is to aim for a soft landing and pivot. That means you should be long gold , long rates, and long risk assets that look cheap. Buy non-tech equities and things that have lagged (Chinese equities). Tech will still rally with rates, but rates are rallying due to an impending recession. G10 liquidity which correlates with commodities is up thanks to China reopening. There are a few reasons to be bullish on risk assets. Lower inflation prints, China reopening, and a strong labour market. This may lead to a premature loosening which will reignite inflation worries. But this may not occur for a few months. Emerging markets will do better with a stronger China (and weaker dollar). We may see some monetary loosening in places like Brazil.

Rates are doing better on account of inflation coming down. Rates also have the benefit of being "right way risk" for a recession. Even when they sell off due to worries around higher rates, there is a pool of liquidity waiting to buy. Money market funds (MMFs) have parked cash in the Reverse Repo Facility (RRP). They could switch to treasuries in a sell-off. The RRP is still at record levels, and MMFs are not yet withdrawing from the facility to buy treasuries. As RRP rates are higher than T-bills, this makes perfect sense. QT has yet to soak up the excess liquidity from this facility. Instead, households are purchasing them with bank deposits. This is decreasing banking system liquidity. See this excellent post by Joseph Wang (https://fedguy.com/trapped-liquidity/).  

It struck me that this situation is analogous to Regulation Q and "disintermediation". Regulation Q was a Great Depression era law that put a ceiling on deposit rates. The government put it in place to prevent banks from paying excessive deposit rates. The logic was that high funding costs led to banks engaging in risky lending. As a result of this policy, depositors fled to other instruments when rates got high. This loss of funding had negative consequences for the housing sector. Banks reduced lending, and the GSEs were not yet available. The situation today is much different, but there are parallels. After the Global Financial Crisis, regulations pushed banks to rely on depositor funding over money markets. Depositors are stickier and less prone to flee in a crisis. After the fiscal stimulus in 2020-21, there are now record amounts of bank deposits. So you have a system with record amounts of bank deposits and a banking system reliant on it for funding. The high level of deposits have allowed the banks to get away with keeping rates low. But how long will this last? How long until the public realizes they can earn 4.5% in 3 month treasuries versus the paltry 1% their banks pay them? At some point treasuries (or money market funds) will be too compelling for the public the ignore. Banks will have to sacrifice yields by paying higher rates or scale back lending. Of course, the latter is one of the goals of the Fed's tightening. But will this happen slowly or all at once? One of three things has to happen. Banks become less profitable, a reduction in credit availability, or the Fed cuts. My bet is that all three occur in that order.

**Risk and Liquidity**  

Besides the need for optimism, there are other reasons why risk assets have stabilized. There is a strong connection between TGA balances and risk asset performance. When TGA balances increase, the Treasury is borrowing money and removing liquidity. When TGA balances draw down, the treasury is stimulating the economy. In Q4'22, the TGA was steady as it couldn't borrow more due to debt ceiling negotiations. The TGA balance is now close to $400bn which could be close to a floor (per Yellen comments). The lack of TGA borrowing neutralized the impact of Fed quantitative tightening. That is, the Treasury wasn't issuing new securities to refinance maturing treasuries. TGA issue may finally get resolved as the House speaker election is now complete. His acrimonious selection does not foreshadow easy debt ceiling negotiations. This is short-term positive for risk assets.

  

**5% Funding Costs** 

The inverted yield curve has killed the carry trade. If you want to be long IG bonds, you either fully fund and pay negative carry or you allow your balance sheet to shrink. For a HY bond earning 6%, your carry (with leverage) is getting close to zero, and so breakeven on price is much lower. Shorting IG risk is now positive carry. That is, you are getting paid to be short-risk. Given the IG supply that has come so far (and will likely continue) and the risk of sticky inflation, short IG looks asymmetrical. Being paid for the chance to receive asymmetrical upside seems unsustainable. Either IG spreads have to widen or funding costs have to decrease.

Non-distressed HY is also looking very asymmetrical. Owning a performing 10% yield bond (CYH or FYBR 1st liens for instance) is now only paying 5% if financed. So hurdle rates have increased since 2021 and net carry has decreased. Cutting risk is the only sensible outcome. CLOs will also be cutting their exposure to HY loans. They are close to hitting trigger points for CCC and HY limits. There's much less money for risky assets.

  

**On my radar -** 

1) Healthcare 

Managed care providers focused on government sponsored plans work under a capitation model. They collect a set amount per patient from the state. In turn they pay providers for all services covered under the plan. This is in contrast to a fee for service model where the state pays providers. The point of managed care is to disincentivize unnecessary care. In theory, they also provide preventative care and other resources. 

#CNC may be a good upgrade candidate. They recently won new contracts for Medicaid in LA (this was a loss for #MOH)  

2) Coal Equities 

Coal equities are very cheap. In particular, Australian names will improve from thawing relations with China. China lifted bans on importing coal for some of its companies. 

3) China Property  

A few days ago, the Chinese government announced they were relaxing their three red lines policy. This policy made it harder for distressed property companies to refinance debt. As has been the case all week, the only positive story in the market is China which is the only economy loosening policy. 

**Prediction Review**  

1) China
Previous belief -

I sold KWEB as I thought the Covid surge and a delayed reopening would cause profit taking.  

Update to priors -

a) Public pressure on Xi was too great, and he realized he had to reopen. I'm reading Marko Papic's Geopolitical Alpha (https://www.amazon.com/Geopolitical-Alpha-Investment-Framework-Predicting/dp/1119740215). His central argument is that constraints matter more than preferences. In China's case, public pressure made the continuation of the lock down impossible. Even with the risk of contagion, they had to reopen. 

b) There needs to be something to buy. This is the only bullish story out there. 

Trade Review 

a) I should've switched from spot to a call. After indices were up 30%+, they would either pop a lot higher or retrace half way. KWEB consolidated around $30; there was clear support there. Moving to an OTM call would have made sense. At first, spot made sense because the timing of the reopening was uncertain.
