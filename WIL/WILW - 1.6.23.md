The first week in 2023 shows the market needs something to get excited about after a difficult 2022. ADP numbers came above expectations and jobless numbers came below. The LPR increased while unemployment decreased, so more people joined the market and found employment. The Fed has signalled it needs a 4.6% unemployment rate versus the current 3.5% (down from 3.6% in Dec). This fits with all of the Fed warnings that labour and wage growth is too strong. Despite what this signals for markets, the S&P rallied hard on optimism that a soft landing may be achieved. 

The playbook seems to be long gold (recession and peak dollar), long rates (better inflation prints and recession worries), and long risk assets that look cheap. That means non-tech equities and things that have lagged (Chinese equities). Tech will still rally with rates, but one must be careful not to get sucked in as rates are rallying due to an impending recession. G10 liquidity which correlates with commodities is up thanks to China reopening. Lower inflation prints plus China reopening plus still strong labour market is likely good for risk assets in the medium term. This may lead to premature loosening which will reignite inflation worries, but that's not happening yet. EM will do better with a stronger China (and weaker dollar) and may see some early loosening in places like Brazil. 

Rates are doing better on account of inflation coming down. Rates also have the benefit of being "right way risk" for a recession. Even when they sell off due to worries around higher rates, there is a pool of liquidity waiting to buy - MMFs who are still in parking funds in the RRP. The RRP spiked in December which  indicates that MMFs are not withdrawing from the facility to purchase treasuries. Instead they're being purchased by households who are using bank deposits and hence decreasing banking system liquidity. Another implication of this (and high TGA balances - see below) is that the effects of QT haven't been realized yet and that it will be difficult to execute without hurting banking system liquidity. For more on this, see this excellent post by Joseph Wang (https://fedguy.com/trapped-liquidity/). 

China is one of the few fundamentally bullish stories I see right now. I was clearly wrong to sell my KWEB stock at the end of Dec. I was right to monetize, but I should've moved some of the gains into OTM calls as price appreciation past $30 was binary. $30 was a clear resistance level and it was either going to partially retrace or spike.

Besides the need for optimitism, there are other reasons why risk assets have stabilized. There is a strong connection between TGA balances and risk asset performance. When TGA balances increase, the Treasury is borrowing money and taking liquidity out of the system which could be used to purchase assets. When TGA balances draw down, the treasury is spending money and stimulating the economy. In Q4'22, the TGA was steady as it couldn't borrow more due to debt ceiling negotiations. The TGA balance is now close to $400bn which could be close to a floor (per Yellen comments). The lack of TGA borrowing neutralized the impact of Fed quantitative tightening. That is, the Treasury wasn't issuing new securities to refinance maturing treasuries. TGA issue may finally  get resolved as the House speaker election is now complete. However, his acrimonious selection does not foreshadow easy debt ceiling negotiations. This is short-term positive for risk assets. 

The inverted yield curve has killed the carry trade. If you want to be long IG bonds, you either fully fund and pay negative carry or you allow your balance sheet to shrink. For a HY bond say earning 6%, your carry (with leverage) is getting close to zero, and so breakeven on price is much lower. Shorting IG risk on the other hand is now positive carry. That is, you are getting paid to be short-risk. Given all of the IG supply that has come so far (and will likely continue) and the risk of sticky inflation, short IG looks increasingly asymmetrical. Being paid for the chance to receive asymmetrical upside seems unsustainable. Either IG spreads have to widen or funding costs have to decrease. 

Non-distressed HY is also looking very asymmetrical. Owning a performing 10% yield bond (CYH or FYBR 1st liens for instance) is now only paying 5% if being financed. So hurdle rates have increased since 2021 and net carry has decreased. Cutting risk is the only sensible outcome. CLOs will also be cutting their exposure to HY loans as they are close to hitting trigger points for maximum CCC and HY limits. Overall, there's much less money for risky assets.

On my radar - 

1) Healthcare 
Managed care providers focused on government sponsored plans (like Centene) work under a capitation fee model. They collect a set amount per patient from the state. In turn they pay providers for all services convered under the plan. This is in contrast to a fee for service model where the state directly pays providers. The point of managed care is to disincentivize unnecessary care. In theory, they also provide preventitive care and other resources. 
#CNC may be a good upgrade candidate. They recently won new contracts for medicaid in LA  (this was a loss for #MOH)


2) Coal Equities
Coal equities are very cheap, and Australian names will improve from thawing relations with China. China lifted bans on importing coal for some of its companies. That, plus easing of restrictions on HY property companies is part of the reopening story 

3) China Property
 Yesterday the Chinese government announced they were relaxing their three red lines policy which made it harder for distressed property companies to refinance debt. As has been the theme all week, the only positive story in the market is China which is the only major economy loosening policy. 
 


**Prediction Review**
1) China
Previous belief - 
I sold KWEB too early as I thought narrative around covid surge and possible delayed reopening would cause profit taking.

Update to priors - 
a) Public pressure on Xi was too great, and he realized he had to fully reopen. Constraints do matter here. 
b) There needs to be something to buy. This is the only bullish story out there. 

Trade Review
a) I should've switched from spot to a call. After indices were up 30%+, it should have been clear that they would pop a lot higher (as were still cheap) or retrace half way. KWEB consolidated around $30; there was clear support there. Moving to a slightly OTM call would have made sense. At first, spot made sense because timing may have taken longer than anticipated.
