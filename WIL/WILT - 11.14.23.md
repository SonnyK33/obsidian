**Beinhart on Middle East**
Defenders of Israel's response to the October terrorist attack make various arguments to explain away the atrocities. They say that Hamas is using civilians as human shields. Even if you take Israel's word, all guerrilla groups do this. So you have condemn asymmetric warfare in general, and that means all violent acts by the weaker party. If you argue that Hamas is responsible for civilian deaths because they provoked the attack, isn't it also true that Israelis provoked the Hamas attacks? Clearly, Hamas has the primary responsibility for the atrocities it committed, regardless of the motivation. But that also applies to the Israeli response. 

They claim that Hamas is exaggerating the statistics on deaths, but in the past, all sides, including the US and Israel have accepted those figures. They blame Palestinians for voting for Hamas, but Hamas won 44% of seats in the West Bank and Jeurasalem as well, so are those people responsible as well?

His main argument is that American Jews are separating themselves from other progressives on this issue. I think this illustrates the point that many of the values we claim to hold are for optics. When challenged, we abandon those values and prioritize primal ones-- security of ourselves, our kind, and extended community. 


**FT on Sunak**
Sacking Braverman and bringing back Cameron is a move to the centre-right. I never thought of Cameron as a centrist figure, but versus the culture warriors and Brexiteers, he's an old-school globalist Tory, not an American-style populist. He was in favour of a closer relationship with China in the past, though I suspect he will be abandoning that position.

**China**
The Medley consultants were in our office today. I learned from the China analyst that annual housing demand is ~10m units a year and supply is currently 9.5m. He's not calling a bottom, but it's clear that it can't keep declining 10% pa. Housing completions are also not an issue. There's a facility from the PBOC which will allow any developer or municipality to finish units and deliver them to the buyer. There are a lot of vacancies, but they're likely focused in cities where demand is low and should be written off. In tier 1 cities, supply is very tight. He said 30m people moved to the cities during covid, that is, during the lockdown! Other interesting stats were that a 1500 sq ft home in Central Beijing costs $1.2m and rents for $2k a year. Prices are very high for the income (~$10k in Beijing).

**Japan**
The Japanese consultant explained that the increase in rates has been so marginal that it has no impact on the behavior of savers. He's also not expecting much of an impact for corporates for now. He thinks the BoJ will defend the Yen at 150.
