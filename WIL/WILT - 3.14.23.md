WILT
Post the bailout of SVB, deposits are flowing out of regional banks and into the large systemic banks. Counter-intuitively, more deposits mean more bond issuance from these banks. More deposits will allow for (and require for margin purposes) more lending. That will increase RWA, and require more TLAC (total loss absorbing capital). TLAC consists of tier 1 capital, sub debt, and some senior bonds (>1 year maturity). So while unsecured bonds are used for funding, they're also needed for regulatory capital purposes. More deposits will require more issuance.
