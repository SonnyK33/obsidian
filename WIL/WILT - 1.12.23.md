WILT
CPI numbers came in line and stocks are about flat. Rates are rallying as a recession and/or cutting is becoming more people's base case. Meme stocks are hot again, and it's clear the market is becoming complacent again. 



Narrative
CPI numbers came in exactly as expected. Market was hoping for a beat and so is down slightly. Fed governor Harker already came out saying 25 bps will be appropriate going forward. While numbers were in line, if you strip out the more volatile components (airfare, health insurance - which doesn't feed into PCE, and housing), core services actually increased from 0.4% to 0.5% MoM.
