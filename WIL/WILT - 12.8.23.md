What's my goal at work? 
I want to develop frameworks to distill complex situations into simple to understand trades. This is the research team's mission statement. Facts have been commoditizied; we can add value by distilling facts into themes and patterns. 

What's the Opportunity?
The research team will aim contribute $100m of PnL in 2024. To achieve this, time management is important. This means calculating the size of an opportunity before committing time to a project. 


How will the research team do this?
All ideas need to be broken into macro and idiosyncratic trades. For macro trades, you need to explain why this credit will be affected more when the catalyst hits. Examples include low FCF/liquidity, high financial/operating leverage, or a business that targets a segment of the market likely to get hit first. Macro trades should be the most liquid expression of the given catalyst. 

Idiosyncratically driven credits should have a catalyst that's one of: capital allocation (e.g. high capex spend), sectoral changes (e.g. seniors shifting to Medicare Advantage which lowers margins for hospitals), or LME actions (e.g. risk of drop-down transactions).

What are not acceptable idiosyncratic catalysts?
1) Mispriced credits (too cheap/expensive).
These trades obviously exist, but fall under a different category from "Research" trades. These are RV/mean-reverting trades that are typically found in IG credits, but may also be found in HY new issues. 
2) High leverage/low liquidity
Many credits will display these traits, but they are not, in and of themselves, catalysts. The market most likely is aware of the credit's fundamentals; the question is, what will change or continue to push the credit. For example, the catalyst for AMC is not its low liquidity, but rather changes in the industry which have shrunk the box office (strikes, streaming, etc). Fundamentals may make a credit a good macro trade (because it's more vulnerable to rising rates, for example). In that case though, the trade should be liquid and compared to similar macro trades. 

How do we conduct credit research?

**Idiosyncratic**
Given the above catalyst types, we can back-solve to find potential credits. 
*Capital Allocation*
- where is capex spending expected to change
- who has a large dividend and will have trouble cutting it (more of an IG issue, but could be relevant)

*Sectoral Changes*
- comes from top-down sector views

Work to do
Forecast FCF over the next 3 years. Your base case should incorporate the capital allocation and sectoral changes that you're expecting. Build scenarios for 1 or 2 alternative outcomes. More scenarios are fine if there are identifiable outcomes (e.g. an election). Where should the credit price in the different scenarios? Calculate the downside-upside and divide it by the spread to benchmark the opportunity to others. 

If there is a liquidity issue in one of the scenarios, calculate the credit's recovery. The downside price should be the recovery value plus coupons you'd collect between now and the maturity wall. 

What is the market's base case, as implied by pricing? How similar is that case to your own base case? If the market is pricing in the most likely case, this may not be a great trade. The trade would only make sense if there's asymmetric upside vs downside. 

*LME*
- who has liquidity issues and large maturity walls

Work to do
Go through the documentation to understand the levers management may employ. Speak to covenant review. Your checklist should be:
1) what is secured capacity (debt and liens covenant)
2) what is investment capacity (Permitted Investments + RP Capacity)
3) can non-guarantor subsidiaries incur substantial debt

What does the capital structure look like in the different scenarios and how do recoveries differ?

Which part of the capital structure is in the most advantageous position? This will likely be the highest priority or the next maturing security. Is there a trade to do based on the most likely scenario? 
Some examples include:
- Long unsecured/short secured if the next to mature bond is unsecured and there's secured capacity. An up-tiering transaction is likely. 
- Long the next to mature security if it is sufficiently low in cash price, and there is investment capacity. It could be exchanged into a structurally senior security in a drop-down transaction


**Macro Trades**
The goal here is to find liquid credits who are more vulnerable to macro (i.e. not firm or sector-specific) catalysts. Before doing any credit work, ensure that the trade can be a meaningful contributor to PnL, as compared to other macro trades focused on the same catalyst. HY callable bonds are almost never good long macro trades (unless they're trading well below par).

***Short Trades***
Credits should have either high financial/operating leverage that will lead to a wide range of outcomes, low liquidity and few levers, or be focused on a vulnerable part of the market.

***Long Trades***
In most cases, long macro trades will be better expressed via index or IG trades, so the bar is high. These will be credits trading low in cash price and below recovery. 

Work to do
Build a FCF model which shows that the credit will face a liquidity issue under plausible scenarios. Explain and quantify the levers that company has.  Where will the credit price in the the different scenarios? How much will you lose if the catalyst moves in the opposite direction? Use that to calculate sizing. 






1) Is macro story improving?
	1) Impact on topline
	2) impact on costs
	3) net impact on EBITDA
2) What are the range of scenarios for topline and costs over the next 3 years
3) What are the range of scenarios of EBITDA/FCF given those scenarios
4) What is consensus view, and are spreads sufficient for range of outcomes?
	1) benchmarking against other credits may be useful here
