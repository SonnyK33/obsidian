WILT
**Venezuela**
Jay Newman (Elliot PM who ran Argentina trade) was on a call discussing Venezuela. He said that any new bonds should be super senior and "undefaultable". This sounds like a good deal for creditors, but would be a disaster for sovereigns. His piece in the FT says that sovereigns should waive sovereign immunity, including for FX reserves held abroad. In his other piece with Ben Heller, he attributes sovereign defaults to corruption and poor institutions. I'm more persuaded by Pettis' argument, that the real cause is excess liquidity flowing from money centers to developing countries. Newman does agree that excess borrowing in FX (rather than local currency) is an issue.
