RIG sees the most opportunities for offshore drilling in Brazil. This underscores how NOC's (national oil companies) have objectives very different from private E&Ps. While the latter are also increasing capex, NOC's never stopped. It also speaks to another theme for Latin America. While most of the governments are now left leaning, commodities are still an important part of their economy. Tthey are unlikely to shut down commodity exports anytime soon, especially if incomes supports social spending. 

US shale had shifted power from the GCC, Russia, Venezuela, and Iran to the US. US shipments picked up the slack when Russian exports to Europe were taken offline. The US became the world's largest producer. That shift is now reversing, as the bakken is expected to produce much less oil and the permian is nearing or past its peak as well. Shale wells produce most of their oil in the first two years and require companies to continuously drill. This leads to persistent negative cashflows and only worked during an era of ultra-loose money. After covid, the markets are no longer rewarding growth stories in energy and instead want capital returned to shareholders. This  reversal will be good for OPEC and may require normalization with Venezuela and Iran.

Narrative
All eyes are on the BOJ meeting. Equities are down slightly and rates are down. This is going against the soft landing narrative that has dominated since the beginning of the year. 


The future is very path dependent. I've been thinking back to the aliens in Slaughter House Five who can see all things at once and have no sense of time. My first thought was that maybe we shouldn't see eveything as causal; sometimes things just happen. The other takeaway though is that as strange as the aliens' view seems to be, we claim to do that all the time. We'll make a call about the future and forget about the path dependency.  This becomes more of a risk the further out you forecast. We're calling for a hard landing and a double dip inflation issue. That could happen, but it's important to remember that the second phase of that won't be apparent for a long time. Pretending we can forecast a complex multi-step future like that is saying we can do what the aliens can do. 

Liquidity has been increasing because of flows coming from the RRP which fell by $211 bn. At the same time, TGA balances have been falling due to the lack of issuances (partially caused by debt ceiling issues). When banks participate in the RRP they exchange bank reserve assets for RRP assets and the Fed does the opposite - extinguishes bank reserve liabilities and creates RRP liabilities. When they withdraw from the facility, the opposite happens. That is, the Fed settles the withdrawal from the RRP by increasing bank reserves (not giving them cash). As would be expected with the RRP decrease, bank reserves are up $250bn in the past 7 days.

Banks could be withdrawing from the RRP to buy bills as the spread has narrowed. But that should lead to TGA balances increasing and bank reserves falling again (I think).


**Reverse repo with commercial banks**
Commercial banks with excess reserves (too much liquidity) can lend them back to Fed using the RRP and get treasuries as collateral. They sell the treasuries back to the Fed at a higher rate, thus earning the reverse repo rate. This temporarily converts their reserve asset into a RRP asset (i.e. a loan to the fed collateralized with treasuries). 

T-Account:
Fed - 
DR reserve liability (reduces liability)
CR Repo liability (increases liability)

Commercial bank - 
DR RRP loan asset (collateral



The Treasury can still issue t-bills. They could issue $200bn by the end of the month. That, plus QT, will lead to a $300bn drain from reserves.  MS is arguing this could lead to a 6% reduction in the S&P given the correlation between liquidity and equity markets. Yellen is using extraordinary measures to issue treasuries despite the debt limit. 

Kenya has the largest financing needs among SSA, and it may have issues with its 2024 maturity. 



Rayonier, a timber company, tried calling its unsecured bonds and issuing a new secured bond. Insufficient investor interest is forcing them to cancel the new issue and redemption.
