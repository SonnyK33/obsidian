**Title**
Banking crises contiue to be the big story with CS getting acquired in a last minute deal between the Swiss government and UBS. Unexpectedly, the AT1s were wiped out while equity holders got some nominal consideration ($3bn from UBS). AT1s are generally thought to rank ahead of shareholders, but the rules differ in every jurisdiction. Switzerland is one of the few where AT1s face full and permanent write-down (I believe Brazil is another). In order to write-down the AT1s, the bank has to be past the point of non-viability. While it seems obvious that CS was past that point on Sunday, UBS did apparently consider it viable, and was paying CHF 3bn for something. The Swiss government also did pass some last minute laws which may have made it easier to write-down AT1s. This episode reminded me of the constraint frame work in [[Geopoltical Alpha]]. As Papic explains, legal constraints are the least important because governments will always find ways to bend the rules. Market participants expect this in emerging markets, but many believe (mistakenly in my opinion) that the West has a much stronger rule of law. When the Swiss government faced the risk of contagion, they passed last minute rules that bypassed the need for shareholder approval and (may) have changed the rules for AT1s. 

When Western governments override their own laws, the justification is always that it was done in the public interest. When bondholders got a worse than expected deal from the auto bailouts in 2009, the same argument was made. When it comes to foreign policy and relations with "adversaries", there are clearly no rules. The West had no problem in confiscating Russian FX reserves. The US government is about to force TikTok to sell itself to a US company. Legal constraints only matter until they don't. Political constraints always trump legal ones when they are at odds with one another. It's likely that ordinary Swiss people owned much more CS stock than AT1s. The Saudi government was also a major investor in the equity. UBS paying something more than a nominal CHF 1 for the company may have also expedited the process. 

**Deposits and Credit Growth**
Actions taken by the Fed and the administration during covid resulted in a huge increase in deposits. These primarily flowed to regional banks. Large systemic banks are subject to stricter leverage requirements, and increases in deposits would require more loss adjusting capital (TLAC). This is partially why regional banks have a much larger proportion of uninsured deposits.

Recent issues with SVB and others are causing depositors to flee regionals for the larger systemic banks. Less deposits at regional banks will mean less credit growth. It also means more bond issuance from the large banks as they beef up on TLAC. The net result is then more supply and less of an ability to absorb that supply. This means higher yields. Less credit will also push up unemployment, as small businesses wonâ€™t be able to access credit as easily. That will result in a freeze in hikes and maybe even cuts. Higher yields but lower rates means much higher credit spreads.

**Trade Review**
I was wrong on Rite-Aid. Even if the stock rebounds and triples from here, I was clearly wrong to buy near $4. I fell into the classic value trap. It looked very cheap in SOTP analysis. My mistake was a simple one. Why was it trading there? Everyone ran the same the SOTP numbers and knew it's worth more broken than as a whole. What was the catalyst for it to realize this intrinsic value? What would change things? Why couldn't it get cheaper. I ignored all of this. Cheap is never a reason to buy something unless there's a strong catalyst for it not to be cheap anymore.
