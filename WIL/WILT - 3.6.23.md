WILT
The market is focusing on Ecuador's political problems but ignoring real economic changes, even those that will be hard to ignore. The market consistently focus on people and naratives, overweighting their preferences over the economic contraints they face. I recently read Geopolitical Alpha by Marko Papic which really hammers this point home. Ecuadorian bonds are in the low 30s for the longest duration and are assuming that potential new radical leader would inexplicably reverse fiscal reforms made by the current President when he has no incentive to do so. While a new leader may run bigger deficits, he has no incentive (or reason) to default on paltry debt service in 2023-25. This the opposite of Nigeria where the market is downplaying political and economic constraints and focusing on what the new leader says he wants to do.

A gavekal piece from a couple weeks ago and a recent piece on the NY Fed's blog are talking about the impact of the dollar's hegemonic status. Gavekal argues that as the dollar loses its reserve status  in Asia, that will allow those economies to invest locally and will lead to more productivity there. The Liberty Street pieces touches on the "Dollar's Imperial Circle" and shows how the dollar acts in a procyclical fashion. Because its usage dwarfs the true role of the US economy, it leads to imbalances. A stronger dollar weakens ex-US global manufacturing because most invoicing is in dollars and it's credit intensive. This weakens ex-US economies more (since the US is less exposed to global trade) which further strengthens the USD. Taking the two pieces together, a diminished dollar may be mean less volatility from hawkish US monetary policy. This will be accompanied by more volatility from other pockets of the market.
