I called this newsletter "Chasing Mersault" because it is my attempt to explain and rationalize everything I see around me. Mersault refers to the main character in Albert Camus' **The Stranger**. People much smarter than me have delved deep into the themes of Camus's classic work. In my view, the book is a metafor for attempting to explain the unexplainable. Sometimes things just happen. There's no reason or rationale. Society attempts to put everything into neat boxes and connect them with a narrative. This newsletter is my attempt to do this with what I read and experience daily in the markets and in life. However, as was the case in **The Stranger**, the attempt may be futile.

**Liquidity and the Markets**

The markets seem to have stabilized in these first two weeks of 2023. This, despite still high inflation and an inverted yield curve. No one really denies that geopolitics have raised the global risk premium. So why has risk performed okay so far?

One argument is that liquidity remains plentiful. We can track liquidity with an index equal to the Fed's balance sheet (SOMA) - the Treasury's general account (TGA) - the Reverse Repo Facility (RRP). If the Fed expands (contracts) its balance sheet, the TGA decreases (increases), or the RRP decreases (increases), overall system liquidity increases (decreases). This index is basically flat since the start of Q4 which coincides with the market trading in a range. Going forward, SOMA will be decreasing (per QT), TGA can't increase materially until the debt ceiling negotiations are restarted, and RRP will be sticky as rates are above 1m t-bills. Interestingly, if the market starts to price in lower odds of cuts this year, that would push up t-bill rates closer to the terminal rate and cause outflows from the RRP. This would be an increase in liquidity. That is, lower odds of a cut, would increase liquidity in the short-term. 

All signs are that debt ceiling negotiations will be difficult and political. Secretary yellen projected that the limit will be breached in January. The TGA is already below $400bn and they don't want it to go any lower. Tax receipts will  also be low due to low capital gains. This may be good for risk as people won't have to sell stocks to pay their taxes.

So to sum up, one reason markets have not sold off hard yet is liquidity remains plentiful. While the Fed has begun QT, its effects have not felt, because the federal government has not been able to issue new debt. Eventually the debt ceiling debacle will get dealt with, and this liquidity will come out of the market. Long-term though, this points to future difficulties in running large fiscal deficits. It means monetary tightening will coincide with fiscal tightening. 
Difficult debt ceiling negotiations may force the democrats to make concessions on medicare advantage spending. While debt ceiling negotiations are idiosyncratic to the US, the theme of declining entitlement spending is global. Macron is trying to increase the retirement age and the recent gilt crisis highlighted what UK pension funds have done to increase yield. 

The spikes in short-term t-bill yields will have other destabilizng effects as well. The post-covid fiscal stimulus led to a credit boom that is continuing. As deposits are sticky, higher rates have allowed banks to increase NIM's. This incentivized banks to increase lending. High wages, low unemployment, and still strong consumer balance sheets have also made it easy for banks to continue lending. All of this means the Fed's actions so far wil not be enough to bring down demand and inflation. There are signs that this is changing though. JPMorgan, in their latest earnings, said deposits were down. Indeed, the delta between treasury bill yields and rates on savings accounts will lead to deposit outflows at some point. I don't know what the split is, but I would guess a large amount of deposits are held by the wealthy. This group is more likely to move money around than the poor or middle class. Eventually deposits outflows will cause a shortfall in banking reserves which will lead to less lending. 

The USD's role as the global reserve currency is being diminished by the split between the US and China and was accelerated by the US confiscating Russia's UST holdings. Less demand for UST will make it harder for the US to finance deficits and will neccessitate less spending or higher tax revenues. At the same time, defense spending is likely to increase. So spending cuts will have to come from somewhere. The entitlements - medicare/medicaid and social security - will be up for discussion.  A comprehensive overhaul of the healthcare system (say to a single payer model) is very unlikely in the short-term but may become increasingly popular. The US spends more than all other countries on healthcare. This is negative for hospitals and manged care companies. 

At the same time as the UST will be losing buyers, inflation vol is likely to increase. Inflation volatility leads to more inflation which further increased volatility and so on. Higher inflation vol means higher term permia and higher long-term yields. That's what happened in the 1960s/70s (check this). So UST will be wider and steeper

*Trade Ideas*
Eurodollar market is pricing in a 1.1% probability of rates being above 5% by December. That is, it's pricing in a 99% chance of a recession, since that's the only realistic scenario where the Fed will be cutting. The market doesn't believe in this higher for longer scenario. This should be a good tail hedge. Short term yields are still pricing in cuts this year, depsite the Fed's repeated warnings. 5 year treasuries may have the most downside here, if market prices in higher for longer rates. 

Decompression starting to look more interesting. More specific catalysts in CCC's and not being paid to take BB or single-B risk. Decompression in long skew which seems like the right way to be positioned, given the market is expecting a soft landing.


**Median Voter Theory (MVT)**
Im reading about MVT in Papic's **Geopolitical Alpha.** He argues that most political leaders are accountable to the median voter and will pay attention to the most important issues affecting  this group. The median voter thus acts as a contraint on the leader and guides his policies. Although this seems obvious, analysts are frequently guilty of ignoring the political constraints facing leaders. There are a few stories right now that can be viewed with this lense.

**Egypt**
Egyptian real wages are down 70% since the Egyptian revolution in 2011. Anecdotally, one analayst said they're the most unhappy they've been in a decade. The IMF did not give them a generous deal and knows that structural reforms, especially a weaker currency, are not tested. The government's most important objective is maintaining social stability. People may be reluctant to come to the streets at first due to the opressive government. However, it was unthinkable that Mubarak would get thrown out like he was in 2011. The backdrop is different this time (no Arab Spring), but the macro situation is much worse. There's still a large funding gap this year. 

**Brazil**
Brazil may be trying to extradite Bolsonaro

**China**
There's still too much residential real estate inventory in China. Even with the reopening, falling house prices may deter may people from buying. The excess inventory will absorb the natural demand. The market will need to see more fundamental improvements (meaning more consumer demand) before new buyers enter the market for bonds. 

**Peru**

**Germany - All quiet on the western front**
	- what about the median Russian today?
	- 
 - 	- phrase from Derby in Slaughter House 5 - war wears down your individuality 
 - war tries to destroy the median voter and turn the entire public into one amorphous jingoistic blob
		- Campbell - compared American settler colonialism with nazism  and said will have to fight the communists eventually
		- US pushing Germany to re-arm 













Peru is *cutting* rates due to mass protests and road blockages. The country has been in turmoil since the previous president (Castillo) was arrested and replaced. This is a complex story, but hightlights how tough things are for emerging markets right now. Rather than loosening policy in response to a crisis, they actually have to tighten. Protests have stopped traffic and the supply goods around the country. Peru's inflation of 8% makes cutting rates impossible. 




*Trade Review*
I made some good calls at the end of the year but I traded incorrectly. Coinbase stock sold off into year end, and I bought a little. The story is tough, but it looked too cheap, especially with talks of a soft landing. I also thought a bullish consensus on gold would be good for bitcoin and Coinbase. I was afraid to buy in size because I'm still bearish on risk assets. Like WBD, I suspected there was tax loss selling in December. Rather than buying an insignificant amount of stock, I should've bought calls. That's true for WBD as well. When you're scared to buy in size but think you're close to an inflection point because something is oversold, you should be buying calls not spot. There was a strong bearish technical at year end (tax loss selling). This was the perfect setup for calls. Simplying buying short-dated calls/puts on equities that  are oversold/overbought is probably a decent strategy. META was another good candidate for January calls.
