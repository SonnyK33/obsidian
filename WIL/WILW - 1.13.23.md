I called this newsletter "Chasing Mersault" because it is my attempt to rationalize everything I see around me. Mersault refers to the main character in Albert Camus' **The Stranger**. People much smarter than me have delved deep into the themes of Camus's classic work. In my view, the book is a metaphor for attempting to explain the unexplainable. Sometimes things just happen. There's no reason or rationale. Society attempts to put everything into neat boxes and connect them with a narrative. This newsletter is my attempt to do this with what I read and experience daily in the markets and in life. However, as was the case in **The Stranger**, the attempt may be futile.

  

**Liquidity and the Markets**
  

The markets seem to have stabilized in these first two weeks of 2023. This, despite still high inflation and an inverted yield curve. No one denies that geopolitics have raised the global risk premium. So why has risk performed okay so far?

  

One argument is that liquidity remains plentiful. We can track liquidity with an index equal to the Fed's balance sheet (SOMA) - the Treasury's general account (TGA) - the Reverse Repo Facility (RRP). If the Fed expands (contracts) its balance sheet, the TGA decreases (increases), or the RRP decreases (increases), liquidity increases (decreases). This index is flat since the start of Q4 which coincides with the market trading in a range. Going forward, SOMA will be decreasing (per QT). TGA can't increase until congress restarts the debt ceiling negotiations. RRP will be sticky as rates are above 1m T-bills. If the market starts to price in lower odds of cuts this year, that would push up T-bill rates closer to the terminal rate. This would cause outflows from the RRP and would be an increase in liquidity. That is, lower odds of a cut, would increase liquidity in the short-term.

  

All signs are that debt ceiling negotiations will be difficult and political. Secretary Yellen projected that the debt will breach the limit in January. The TGA is already below $400bn and they don't want it to go any lower. Tax receipts will also be low due to low capital gains. This may be good for risk as people won't have to sell stocks to pay their taxes.

  

So to sum up, one reason markets have not sold off hard yet is liquidity remains plentiful. While the Fed has begun QT, its effects have not felt. The federal government has not been able to issue new debt. Eventually, the debt ceiling debacle will get dealt with, and this liquidity will come out of the market. Long-term though, this points to future difficulties in running large fiscal deficits. It means monetary tightening will coincide with fiscal tightening.

Difficult debt ceiling negotiations may force the democrats to make concessions on Medicare advantage spending. While debt ceiling negotiations are idiosyncratic to the US, the theme of declining entitlement spending is global. French President Macron is trying to increase the retirement age, and the recent gilt crisis highlighted what UK pension funds have done to increase yield.

  

The spikes in short-term T-bill yields will have other destabilizng effects as well. The post-covid fiscal stimulus led to a credit boom that is continuing. As deposits are sticky, higher rates have allowed banks to increase NIM's. This incentivized banks to increase lending. High wages, low unemployment, and still strong consumer balance sheets also made it easy for banks to continue lending. This means the Fed's actions so far wil not be enough to bring down demand and inflation. There are signs that this is changing though. JPMorgan, in their latest earnings, said deposits were down. Indeed, the delta between treasury bill yields and rates on savings accounts will lead to deposit outflows at some point. I don't know what the split is, but I would guess a large amount of deposits are held by the wealthy. This group is more likely to move money around than the poor or middle class. Eventually deposits outflows will cause a shortfall in banking reserves which will lead to less lending.

  

Dollar as the Reserve Currency

  

The USD's role as the global reserve currency is being diminished by the split between the US and China. The US confiscating Russia's treasury holdings accelerated this process. Less demand for UST will make it harder for the US to finance deficits and will require less spending or higher tax revenues. At the same time, defense spending is likely to increase. So spending cuts will have to come from somewhere. The entitlements - medicare/medicaid and social security - will be up for discussion. A comprehensive overhaul of the healthcare system (say to a single payer model) is very unlikely in the short-term but may become increasingly popular. The US spends more than all other countries on healthcare. This is negative for hospitals and manged care companies.

  

At the same time as the UST will be losing buyers, inflation volaility is likely to increase. Inflation volatility leads to more inflation which further increased volatility and so on. Higher inflation volatility means higher term premia and higher long-term yields. That's what happened in the 1960s/70s. So UST will be wider and steeper
















Peru is *cutting* rates due to mass protests and road blockages. The country has been in turmoil since the previous president (Castillo) was arrested and replaced. This is a complex story, but hightlights how tough things are for emerging markets right now. Rather than loosening policy in response to a crisis, they actually have to tighten. Protests have stopped traffic and the supply goods around the country. Peru's inflation of 8% makes cutting rates impossible. 




*Trade Review*
I made some good calls at the end of the year but I traded incorrectly. Coinbase stock sold off into year end, and I bought a little. The story is tough, but it looked too cheap, especially with talks of a soft landing. I also thought a bullish consensus on gold would be good for bitcoin and Coinbase. I was afraid to buy in size because I'm still bearish on risk assets. Like WBD, I suspected there was tax loss selling in December. Rather than buying an insignificant amount of stock, I should've bought calls. That's true for WBD as well. When you're scared to buy in size but think you're close to an inflection point because something is oversold, you should be buying calls not spot. There was a strong bearish technical at year end (tax loss selling). This was the perfect setup for calls. Simplying buying short-dated calls/puts on equities that  are oversold/overbought is probably a decent strategy. META was another good candidate for January calls.
