You can track system wide liquidity with SOMA - TGA - RRP (per Felix Jauvin). This index is basically flat since the start of Q4 which coincides with the market trading in a range. Going forward, SOMA will be decreasing (per QT), TGA can't increase materially until the debt ceiling negotiations are restarted (though will get a boost with the House speaker election), and RRP will continue to attract flows as RRP rates are above 1m t-bills. If the market starts to discount the chance of cuts this year, that will push up t-bill rates closer to the terminal rate and cause outflows from the RRP which would be an increase in liquidity. All signs are that debt ceiling negotiations will be difficult and political.

The post-covid fiscal stimulus led to a credit boom that is continuing. As deposits are sticky, higher rates have allowed banks to increase NIM's. This incentivized banks to increase lending. High wages, low unemployment, and still strong consumer balance sheets have also made it easy for banks to continue lending. All of this means the Fed's actions so far wil not be enough to bring down demand and inflation. There are signs that this is changing though. JPMorgan, in their latest earnings, said deposits were down. Indeed, the delta between treasury bill yields and rates on savings accounts will lead to deposit outflows at some point. I don't know what the split is, but I would guess a large amount of deposits are held by the wealthy. This group is more likely to move money around that the poor or middle class.

Brazil may be trying to extradite Bolsonaro


Stocks are finally down after a strong start to year and on fears around rising rates.  Gold and oil are still higher. The focus today is on Powell speaking and what his response will be to the strong markets since Q4 and what that implies for FCI easing. Inflation has continued to come down as expected. After the latest print came in line with forecasts, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Harker said he would be comfortable with 25 bp increases from here. While numbers were in line, if you strip out the more volatile components (airfare, health insurance - which doesn't feed into PCE, and housing), core services actually increased from 0.4% to 0.5% MoM.


 Short term yields are still pricing in cuts this year, depsite the Fed's repeated warnings. 5 year treasuries may have the most downside here, if market prices in higher for longer rates. 


Difficult debt ceiling negotiations may force the democrats to make concessions on medicare advantage spending. This will hurt hospitals and managed care providers (especially UNH).  While debt ceiling negotiations are idiosyncratic to the US, the theme of declining entitlement spending is global. Macron is trying to increase the retirement age and the recent gilt crisis highlighted what UK pension funds have done to increase yield. 

There's still too much residential real estate inventory in China. Even with the reopening, falling house prices may deter may people from buying. The excess inventory will absorb the natural demand. The market will need to see more fundamental improvements (meaning more consumer demand) before new buyers enter the market for bonds. 


On the funding topic, fed funds versus IG spread is in the second percentile. You can't own the index if you're levered. 

The USD's role as the global reserve currency is being diminished by the split between the US and China and was accelerated by the US confiscating Russia's UST holdings. Less demand for UST will make it harder for the US to finance deficits and will neccessitate less spending or higher tax revenues. At the same time, defense spending is likely to increase. So spending cuts will have to come from somewhere. The entitlements - medicare/medicaid and social security - will be up for discussion.  A comprehensive overhaul of the healthcare system (say to a single payer model) is very unlikely in the short-term but may become increasingly popular. The US spends more than all other countries on healthcare. This is negative for hospitals and manged care comapnies. Stifel economist argued the Fed may start YCC like Japan and will issue more bills than long-term bonds. He argued this was good for equities (I guess because of negative real rates?) and definitely good for gold. At the same time as the UST will be losing buyers, inflation vol is likely to increase. Inflation volatility leads to more inflation which further increased volatility and so on. Higher inflation vol means higher term permia and higher long-term yields. That's what happened in the 1960s/70s (check this). So UST will be wider and steeper?

CPI numbers came in line and stocks are about flat. Rates are rallying as a recession and/or cutting is becoming more people's base case. Meme stocks are hot again, and it's clear the market is becoming complacent again. 


Egyptian real wages are down 70% since the Egyptian revolution in 2011. Anecdotally, one analayst said they're the most unhappy they've been in a decade. The IMF did not give them a generous deal and knows that structural reforms, especially a weaker currency, are not tested. The government's most important objective is maintaining social stability. People may be reluctant to come to the streets at first due to the opressive government. However, it was unthinkable that Mubarak would get thrown out like he was in 2011. The backdrop is different this time (no Arab Spring), but the macro situation is much worse. There's still a large funding gap this year. 


Peru is *cutting* rates due to mass protests and road blockages. The country has been in turmoil since the previous president (Castillo) was arrested and replaced. This is a complex story, but hightlights how tough things are for emerging markets right now. Rather than loosening policy in response to a crisis, they actually have to tighten. Protests have stopped traffic and the supply goods around the country. Peru's inflation of 8% makes cutting rates impossible. 




*Debt Limit*
Sec yellen projected that the limit will be breached in January. TGA is already below $400bn and they don't want it to go any lower. Tax receipts are also likely to be low due to low capital gains. This may be good for risk versus in strong years and people have to sell stocks to pay their taxes.

I made some good calls at the end of the year but I traded incorrectly. Coinbase stock sold off into year end, and I bought a little. The story is tough, but it looked too cheap, especially with talks of a soft landing. I also thought a bullish consensus on gold would be good for bitcoin and Coinbase. I was afraid to buy in size because I'm still bearish on risk assets. Like WBD, I suspected there was tax loss selling in December. Rather than buying an insignificant amount of stock, I should've bought calls. That's true for WBD as well. When you're scared to buy in size but think you're close to an inflection point because something is oversold, you should be buying calls not spot. There was a strong bearish technical at year end (tax loss selling). This was the perfect setup for calls. Simplying buying short-dated calls/puts on equities that  are oversold/overbought is probably a decent strategy. META was another good candidate for January calls. 

Eurodollar market is pricing in a 1.1% probability of rates being above 5% by December. That is, it's pricing in a 99% chance of a recession, since that's the only realistic scenario where the Fed will be cutting. 

*Funding Costs cont'd*
Decompression starting to look more interesting. More specific catalysts in CCC's and not being paid to take BB or single-B risk. Decompression in long skew which seems like the right way to be positioned. Given the market is expecting a soft landing (ED markets pricing in a very small probability of rates being above 5% at yearend).
