A lot (most?) HY deals are coming with OIDs. The market is demanding a certain yield, but issuers can't afford that much interest expense. In some extreme examples, they literally can't service that much interest. They reconcile this by issuing at below par. But they're borrowing par, and that will have to be repaid in 5-8 years. This indicates to me that a good portion of the HY universe simply doesn't work at these rates. Few credits can pay 12% interest, and so they issue at 10% with an OID. The question is if the use of proceeds will allow them to generate high enough returns to pay back par.
