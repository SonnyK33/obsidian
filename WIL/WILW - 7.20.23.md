**Title**
Rite Aid
The DOJ joined a whistleblower lawsuit against Rite-Aid in March of this year. Charges were filed under the FCA (false claims act) and the CSA (controlled substances act). FCA are fraud charges, and are not dischargeable in bankruptcy. According to the litigator I spoke to, the government does not want to bankrupt Rite-Aid and does want to get paid. But it won't hesitate to push into a filing if necessary. I'm not how to square both of these claims, given RAD's precarious state. 

The company filed a motion to dismiss in June, and these typically take 6-12 months to rule on. The lawyer I spoke with said defendants would typically wait for a ruling before settling. The exception could be if the government offered an exceptionally good deal. The judge is also an Ohio public defender, so likely not sympathetic towards RAD.
