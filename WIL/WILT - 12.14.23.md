WILT

The binding constraint for Enova is, at the end, just charge-offs. Everything else, revolver covenant, even securitization funding, will be driven by charge-offs. It wouldn't require a large increase in defaults for the securitized debt to get impaired, but until that happens, the market is open for them. In the end, this is a macro trade, but with a very low attachment point. 

Walgreens was recently defaulted. It looks okay here, but there's execution risk with its urgent care business. Its key lever is selling the UK business (Boots), which just became incrementally easier given the easing of rates and funding conditions.
