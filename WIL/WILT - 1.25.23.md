Some officials have called for the Fed to change the spread between the RRP and resereve back to 25 bps from the current 10. This will cause QT to pull money from the RRP rather than reserves.

This plus a Fed governor's announcement that bank reserves and RRP should both be treated as liquidity means deposit rates will have to increase. Unless corporate profitability starts to go up, lending will be less profitable as NIMs shrink. 

If Argentina's tax to GDP rate was comparable to Brazil (is currently 19 vs 36%), that would close the fiscal gap. Persisent high fiscal deficits crowd out private investment and keep local yields high. This makes foreign investment difficult and limits the ability to generate adequate hard currency for its debtload. The lack of foreign investment devalues the currency. A weak currency makes imports expensive. Rather than allowing that pain to hit the people, it allows importers to buy USD at artifical rates, using up the country's reserves.

For all trades, need to articulate why it trades where it does. How did that factor perpetuate over time pushing the valuation away where it should be. For Argentina, it's due to the low coupons on the bonds and getting everyone flushed out.  Everyone is focused on the debtload and not looking at where the current account can go. 

From macro ops,
1) analytical edge - look for the underlying factors and see if can come to an out of consensus conclusion 
2) look over overreactions in either direction - similar to my "assets at extremes"
3) "arbitrage time" by taking a medium/long-term view
	1) requires macro thinking

Option implied probabilities on eurodollar future Dec '24 options imply 10% odds of rates below 1.5 (i.e. a recession) and a 14% probabilitiy of rates between 4-6 (higher for longer). The odds are 1% and 39% for recession and higher for longer for the Dec '23 contract. So eurodollar market is expecing higher for longer through this year, with odds for a recession rising next year, but still low. Macrocompass' view is that this shows the market is not expecting a recession but disinfinlation to 2% which allows the Fed to cut to neutral rates (which are positive in real terms).
