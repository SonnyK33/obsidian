Ti02
Titanium dioxide (and many other industrial commodities) correlate with inflation. If inflation continues to come down, we should expect these commodities to disinflate as well. For Tronox, consensus is for prices to stay roughly flat. 

Borr Drilling
The bond has a cash flow sweep at 105% of par. That puts a floor on prices. It also puts a cap on prices, but that's already there with the call price.

Citgo
MId-cycle EBITDA is $1.75bn. The pricing differential on PDVSA 20s and the unsecureds implies a mid-4 multiple on Citgo. That's only a small discount to Valero. That doesn't seem sufficient for the process risks.
