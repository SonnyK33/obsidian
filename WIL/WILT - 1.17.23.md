RIG sees the most opportunities for offshore drilling in Brazil. This underscores how NOC's (national oil companies) have objectives very different from private E&Ps. While the latter are also increasing capex, NOC's never stopped. It also speaks to another theme for Latin America. While most of the governments are now left leaning, commodities are still an important part of their economy. Tthey are unlikely to shut down commodity exports anytime soon, especially if incomes supports social spending. 

US shale had shifted power from the GCC, Russia, Venezuela, and Iran to the US. US shipments picked up the slack when Russian exports to Europe were taken offline. The US became the world's largest producer. That shift is now reversing, as the bakken is expected to produce much less oil and the permian is nearing or past its peak as well. Shale wells produce most of their oil in the first two years and require companies to continuously drill. This leads to persistent negative cashflows and only worked during an era of ultra-loose money. After covid, the markets are no longer rewarding growth stories in energy and instead want capital returned to shareholders. This  reversal will be good for OPEC and may require normalization with Venezuela and Iran.

Narrative
All eyes are on the BOJ meeting. Equities are down slightly and rates are down. This is going against the soft landing narrative that has dominated since the beginning of the year.
