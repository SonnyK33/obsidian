[[Thinking in Systems]]
As I've been looking at Enova and Sunnova, I've been trying to think about the systems framework. Especially for Enova, the stocks and flows are important to understand. Is it a reinforcing loop or a balancing loop? 

I see two systems-- the loan balance and liquidity. 
For loans, the stock is the ending balance. Flows are originations (inflows), interest income (inflows which are accrued), repayments (outflows), and charge-offs (outflows). The higher the balance, the higher the interest income, so this loop is reinforcing. 

For liquidity (cash), the balance is cash, the flows are  principal repayment (inflow), interest income (inflow), external funding (inflow), origination (outflow), and expenses (outflow). How are the flows dependent on the balance? More liquidity will allow for more origination, which should lead to more interest income, which increases liquidity. So this loop is reinforcing as well. 

Because the duration the loans is so short, the buffer (i.e. the stock of loans) is very slim. That's a vulnerability versus other lenders. What are the limiting factors or binding constraints. Origination exceeds repayment, since they have so many bad loans. In the last quarter, charge-offs were ~$1bn. Interest income is roughly double total cash expenses, but the excess is only ~$300m. Liquidity can only increase via external funding. 

**Edge**
I've been thinking more about my (and the research team's) edge. A couple things from [[The Laws of Trading]] resonated with me. He emphasizes the value of storytelling to convey a simple thesis and to articulate your edge. I also got some ideas about risk budgeting. He said a good story should alter some beliefs; that is, if the trade is to work, some aspect of it must be new. I should be explicitly stating this. If it doesn't change beliefs, it may be too good to be true. Another way to think about this is, how much are you risking? This got me thinking on how to calculate my risk budget. What's target PnL, how many trades can we execute in a given time period, what kind of trade is this, etc.
