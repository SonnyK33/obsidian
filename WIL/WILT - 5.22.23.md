Builders will generate CF immediately after orders drop. Their backlog will be a source of cash in the short-term. This is true for other companies that have a large backlog as well (e.g. CSCO). Even though the lower backlog will lead to lower future earnings, this will be masked by releases of CF immediately. It'll be important to track capital allocation decisions of management in this interim period, especially their propensity to buy back stock to help equity prices.
