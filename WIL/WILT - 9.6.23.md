Ecuador
The "market-friendly" leader in Ecuador is much more centrist than his predecessor, Lasso. Notably, he's in favor of strong unions, whereas Lasso pushed for more labour flexibility. As discussed in [[WILT - 8.22.23]], dollarized economies like Ecuador need labour flexibility since the exchange rate can't adjust to weaker conditions.
