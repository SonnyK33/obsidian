The Treasury can still issue t-bills. They could issue $200bn by the end of the month. That, plus QT, will lead to a $300bn drain from reserves.  MS is arguing this could lead to a 6% reduction in the S&P given the correlation between liquidity and equity markets. Yellen is using extraordinary measures to issue treasuries despite the debt limit. 

Kenya has the largest financing needs among SSA, and it may have issues with its 2024 maturity.
