**Stocks and Flows - Pettis on Treasures**
I previously rationalized the argument that fewer foreign purchases of treasuries may actually coincide with a lower supply, and hence won't lead to higher yields. The logic is that fewer purchases of treasuries implies a lower current account deficit in the US. That implies a higher savings rate, which means some combination of more private savings or a lower budget deficit. Because the US isn't capital starved, the foreign savings being dumped in the US right now are not increasing investment, but rather depressing savings. This manifests through higher unemployment (a weaker export sector), or fiscal deficits. Hence, a reversal in these flows should result in lower fiscal deficits and higher private savings. This means lower treasury issuance. Pettis' argument is hence that fewer foreign purchases of treasuries won't lead to higher yields. 

There are a few flaws in this reasoning. First, he's obviously assuming that other variables don't change as this shock works through the balance of payments. But a stronger export sector and more tax revenue could be matched by more fiscal spending. That seems to be almost obvious. There will be pushes for tax cuts and military spending from the right and social spending from the left. Second, there's the issue of timing. One insight from [[Thinking in Systems]] has been that flows respond to stocks not other flows. Stocks also serve as buffers and delay the response function. While Pettis' logic may be right, it will take a while to work through the system. He's also been arguing for a slowdown in China due to its imbalances for many years. His chain of reasoning is right and in relies on accounting identities, but it can take a long time for those imbalances to reverse.

Fiscal deficits will respond to the level of unemployment and tax revenue (among other things). Employment patterns won't change over night even with more export revenue in the manufacturing sector. Higher profits for exporters won't instantly translate to higher wages, even with stronger labour unions. 

What are the stocks and flows in the balance of payments argument?
*Stocks*
Treasury Holdings
Domestic Savings

*Flows*
Foreign purchases (outflow for the US, inflow for rest of world)
Treasury issuance (inflow for the US)
Net US exports - the mirror image of foreign purchases 

Treasury issuance -> US holdings -> Foreign holdings 


**Credits with EBIT < Interest**
Looking at VSCO whose interest expense is nearly equal to EBIT. Interest is an outflow and is a function of capital markets. Higher profitability should lead to higher rates. That's the balancing loop. EBIT are inflows of capital and come from the consumer. Consumer spending is a renewable resource which growth with wages and economic growth--- the same loop that drives interest rates. If people spend too much on consumption, they'll have less money to invest, which reduces the potential of the wealth effect. VSCO's asset value is a function of invested capital which is a function of these two loops. If rates increase faster than consumption (driven by wages and beliefs about future wealth appreciation), the asset will deplete over time. What's growing faster - interest rates or consumption?
