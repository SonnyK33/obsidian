WILT
Chinese youth unemployment now equal to that of Italy (20%), from 10% in 2018. Domestic demand is still lagging which is constraining consumption-led growth. Part of the problem is also that graduates are increasingly reluctant to accept low salaries. The high investment model has relied on a high savings rate which has required a low share of national income going to workers. There is increasing push back from young people, as they seek to recoup the cost of their education.
