We went over Enova and Sunnova today at the research meeting. I was thinking more about these two names and my volatility framework for spreads. Both bonds are 2028s with similar coupons. Equity/EV for NOVA is 10%. Enova is a lender, and so leverage is more complicated. 
The range of outcomes is  different for the two credits. I see Sunnova with a range 60-105, while for Enova, it's 0-107. Enova's range is double Sunnova's due to the very low recovery in a downturn. Sunnova's 2028s are +1,250 spread while Enova is +700. So it costs almost double to buy a put on Sunnova than Enova. Sunnova relies on government subsidies to survive, but those subsidies aren't going anywhere. It would be very hard for Republicans to repeal the IRA, and it's unlikely they'd even want to, given all of the special interests that benefitted from it. Enova's business isn't reliant on government subsidies but on usurious rates of interest and ongoing issuance. 

We've spent a lot of time determining whether Sunnova loses money on a per unit basis, and it appears they do after corporate interest. Their access to funding though is reliant on new origination, which is why we think they'll keep selling panels. Enova doesn't yet lose money on a per unit basis, despite 20% average charge-offs, due to the high rates of interest they charge. Ironically, because Enova doesn't lose on a per unit basis, they may be worse off in a worsening credit environment. They'll be incentivized to keep originating to earn 50%+ interest rates. Sunnova may actually start cutting customer acquisition costs, as that will be the best way to conserve cash. 

Enova has some interesting accounting policies. They appear to accrue all interest income. But rather than substracting "non-cash interest income" on their Cash Flow statement, they appear to deduct it from principal collections, which appears in the "Cash Flow from Investments" section. This may seem trivial, and perhaps it is. But it has led to an erroneous FCF measure on Bloomberg, and it understates the percentage loss needed to use up liquidity. They collected ~$4bn in principal repayments, but only show $2bn on their CF statement. The missing $2bn is a result of netting against the non-cash interest. So a 10% increase in loss rate equates to $400m less cash, which is 20% of the line on their CF statement. This accounting trick hides the impact of worsening credit quality.
