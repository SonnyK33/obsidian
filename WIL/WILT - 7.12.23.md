WILT
Chinese property names won't be a buy until, at the very least, there is more consumer stimulus and aid for indebted local governments. Aid to developers can help with liquidity but won't help the underlying problem of too much supply and insufficient consumer demand.


LUMEN/Level 3
Level 3, a subsidiary of Lumen, sold of assets in Latin America and used some of the proceeds to pay down unsecured debt. Per the asset sale covenant, proceeds should have gone to secured bonds and term loans first. There is a provision however allowing them to spend it on capex within ~2 years. The company can claim that money is fungible, and they'll eventually spend it on capex. This may get litigated and could take a while to sort out. 

**Rite Aid**
Current prices imply investors think this will last for a while and recovery will get eaten up from draws on the revolver. Some believe the company may use a filing to get away from opioid liabilities which would be unsecured claims.
