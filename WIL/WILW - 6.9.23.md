**Title**
FHLB banks are quasi-government entities set up to support commercial bank mortgage lending activities. Executives are compensated on the basis of assets (e.g. head of SF HLB made $2.4m last year). The program manages $1.5 trillion, but only 350m went towards affordable housing. They functionally provide liquidity to big banks, even though those aren't the major originators of mortgages. 

There was a story on Friday that AMZN was in talks with wireless operators to offer services to its prime customers. Negotiating an MVNO with the big 3 (VZ, T, TMUS) would be tough, as they wouldn't want a new player to undercut their retail business. They're also not under any obligation to open up their network (operators in Europe have had to open up their fixed line / FTTH grids since the 1990s). US ARPUs are much higher than in Europe ($45 vs 11 in Germany), which may be incentivizing tech to get involved. DISH is the only major spectrum owner who would be incentivized to sell services to AMZN, but their network will only cover 70% of the country by 6/23. TMUS by contrast covers the whole country with 5G.

DISH uses Open RAN (as does RAKUTEN in Japan) which is untested and may have contributed to delays in rollout.

**Savings Rate**
Colombia has a high current account deficit. However, it's completely financed by FDI, and is a consequence of a high investment rate (and a stable government) relative to low domestic savings. The debits which decrease the current account come from profits earned by foreign companies operating in Colombia. Most of these profits are reinvested as FDI, neutralizing the flow. 


China now accounts for 25% of leading edge cancer drugs, from 10% in 2017. The number of drugs originated from China has gone from 300 to 1,200 in that period. Astra Zeneca has defied the current cold war with China to look for M&A opportunities there and to work with local scientists. 

**Turkey**
Turkey's balance of payment crisis is similar to the currency crisis Mexico went through in 1994. Mexico issued dollar-denominated local debt to gain credibility, which ended up increasing their FX debt load and turned the currency crisis into a credit crisis. Turkey similarly guaranteed the exchange rate on TRY deposits and has borrowed heavily from commercial banks. the one thing going for Turkey is most debt is owed domestically (even FX debt) in the form of dollar deposits. The government may be able to impose capital controls or restrictions on dollar deposits and prioritize payments on Eurobonds. The banks look like a good short in any scenario - either they have a crisis/default or they punish the banks which are the central banks' largest creditor. 

**Trades**
Sometimes we focus too much on free or cheap options and ignore the harder but potentially more lucrative trades. We exaggerate the asymmetry of the cheap options because we assume we'd realize the full downside. But in reality, if we're short a front-end bond which sells off to 95, we're likely to just cover it. So the real downside is just 5 pts. Once we have that trade on, we tend to ignore the rest of the capital structure. But when the front-end bond drops 5 pts the rest of the curve will drop much more. Obviously the further out bonds have risk on the other side, but you have to do enough work to get comfortable with the asymmetry. 

Read "The Upside of Rivalry" in Foreign Affairs April/May by Nirupama Rao, a former Indian Foreign Secretary. She highlights how India is aptly playing both sides of the building rivalry between the US and China/Russia. Like Turkey, India may be benefiting from the new cold war. Countries at the crossroads - Turkey, India, Saudi Arabia, possibly Mexico, South Africa, and South Korea - may be able to extract concessions from both sides, and end up the real winners.
