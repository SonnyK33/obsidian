[[Inflation]]

WILT
The Fed is projecting that PCE gets back to 2% even with wages growing at 2x the pre-covid rate. The Fed's model assumes workers will keep pushing for higher wages, given inflation. The only way PCE can fall while wages remain elevated is if everything else falls. That is, firms don't pass on wage growth to consumers. That implies lower margins, lower profits, and a larger output gap (the Fed is implying it goes negative by Q3). So the Fed is forecasting a recession by Q3. 

High cash rates have decreased carry everyhwere. Carry defined as yields less risk free cash rates or the roll yield on equity futures have come down across the board. This is most pronounced in the US. Using earnings yield, a 60/40 portfolio is now negative carry versus 2% in Europe and 4.5% in Japan. The relatively higher earnings yields outside the US are due to lower valuations. US HY less 3m treasury tields are the lowest they've been since the GFC.
