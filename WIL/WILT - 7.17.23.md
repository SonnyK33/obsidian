Azul
This Brazilian airline issued new first and second liens to refinance its balance sheet after emerging from the covid era. The deal came very wide (12.5%), given its 3 notch downgrade from 2019 and the taint from the distressed exchange. When I compare it to 2019, it looks surprisingly okay. Its margins would be higher than 2019, if not for much higher fuel prices. In 2019, the unsecureds traded +300, 150 wide of the sovereign, and leverage was 3.5x. Current leverage through this tranche is about the same 3.5x net, and it's secured against the best assets (the loyalty program, tour operator, and cargo business). Fuel prices are a risk, but they're typically correlated with a stronger BRL which is a tailwind. There is a world where fuel prices are higher and the BRL is weaker, but I think the sovereign would wider there also. BRL and fuel price risk (along with general risk) are easier to hedge with other trades in our book.
