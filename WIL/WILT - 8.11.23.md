WILT

Chinese officials may be reluctant to use fiscal stimulus because they think it'll be difficult to restore the budget balance once the economy recovers. During the 2008 crisis, the government lost its export markets and so shifted excess savings to domestic investments. These have now become unprofitable and have caused a huge increase in debt. It was hard to turn this policy off once they started. 

When exports fell, the trade deficit increased (LHS). Either the investments relative to savings have to increase or fiscal surplus has to decrease. 
M - X = (I - S) -Â (T - G)

Fitting with that argument, there are reports that central government officials are pressuring local governments to restructure their debts. Many of these were incurred by lending to property companies which are now insolvent. They're trying to get debt under control, and so may be reluctant to incur more debt to fund fiscal stimulus. 

**RRP**
Reverse repo facility balances have stabilized, as money market funds have stopped withdrawing cash. MMF have been withdrawing funds from the RRP to purchase treasury bills as the Treasury started to issue again after the debt ceiling was lifted. They're now getting close to their limits for treasury bills, and the RRP is paying a better rate than bills. The RRP reflects the fed funds rate. T-bill yields have come down, as the market is expecting a cut, and other investors are shifting from bank deposits to T-bills. If RRP withdrawals are not funding new bills, it will have to come from banking reserves. Coupled with QT, this will mean a reduction of system-wide liquidity.
