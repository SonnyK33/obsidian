WILT
I've gone through this a few times, but it's important to categorize the work that we do.

HY Opportunities:
1) Trade types - thematic (based on these questions), new deals (including reverses), and opportunistic (event-driven based on newsflow, corporate actions, etc)
	1) Thematic - based on above opportunity sizing
	2)  What are potential new issues?
	3) Opportunistic are hard to predict ahead of time

IG Opportunities:
1) BBB-/BB+ names that could go in one direction or another (VISTA, NRG, RCI, WBA, Chem names)

EM Opportunities:
1) Sovereigns - need to articulate framework
2) Corps
	1) Distressed opportunities that have become illiquid but are large and could provide asymmetric opportunities (ODEBRE, SAMMIN, etc)
	2) Extensions of HY thematic trades (AZUL)


The weekly agenda should be separated into these categories
