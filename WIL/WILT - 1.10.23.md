Narrative
Stocks are finally down after a strong start to year and on fears around rising rates.  Gold and oil are still higher. The focus today is on Powell speaking and what his response will be to the strong markets since Q4 and what that implies for FCI easing. Sticky wage inflation is increasing fears around another 50 bp raise. Short term yields are still pricing in cuts this year, depsite the Fed's repeated warnings. 5 year treasuries may have the most downside here, if market prices in higher for longer rates. 
Difficult debt ceiling negotiations may force the democrats to make concessions on medicare advantage spending. This will hurt hospitals and managed care providers (especially UNH).  While debt ceiling negotiations are idiosyncratic to the US, the theme of declining entitlement spending is global. Macron is trying to increase the retirement age and the recent gilt crisis highlighted what UK pension funds have done to increase yield.
