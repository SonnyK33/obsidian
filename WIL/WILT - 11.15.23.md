Hawaii Airlines
The Japanese Yen's depreciation's had a big impact on Hawaii Airlines. It's depreciated 50% since 2019. Pacific routes (mainly Japan) used to account for 25% of it's revenue. Sean doesn't like this one, so it will be hard to put this one one. But it's important to identify the drivers of the trade, in case they think. HA's revenue fall has had 3 main causes:
1) shift from US to international travel (strong dollar, pent up demand)
2) Maui fires
3) Japanese Yen
