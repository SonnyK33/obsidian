BRBR (Bellrings), the maker of Pure Protein snacks, has fared pretty well. This was a lazy short in hindsight. They're a one product company, but leverage is low (2x now) and they've done a good job with expanding capacity.

Solar Panels
Three-quarters of solar panels are manufactured in China. Many other integral parts of the supply chain are also centered in China. The Biden administration is attempting to shut down access to the Chinese market for cheap solar panels. Part of the supposed rationale is that many of the panels are manufactured in the Xinjang region. As the government is trying to shut down that market, it's incentivizing its own by offering tax credits through the IRA. How many of those companies will need these credits after the 10-year period to survive?

Polysilicon is also used for semiconductor chips, and those manufacturers pay a premium over solar panels. In this way, the chip industry subsidizes the solar panel industry. A slowdown in chip demand would hurt solar panel manufacturers, as they'd be forced to pay higher prices. 

IHeart
I haven't looked at this one in a while. The key driver has been the shift from linear to digital advertising. While its digital business (podcasts and streaming) have done well, they're lower margin than terrestrial advertising. We've seen this trend in many other credits as well. Streaming versus linear TV for example. 

The unsecured and secured tranches are trading close in cash price, while it seems the former would have minimal recovery in a bankruptcy. The reason lies with the permissive bond covenants. The company could engage in an uptiering transaction in which it issues more secured debt to take out the unsecured. The relevant covenants are the debt and lien covenants. The first allows for incremental issuance that's refinancing. The lien covenant has a "negative pledge" that restricts secured debt unless it's pari with the outstanding debt. As Covenant Review says, that's the normal formulation for an unsecured indenture. However, the purpose of a liens covenant in a secured bond indenture, is to prevent dilution of the collateral. In this case, more secured debt could be issued to take out the unsecureds.
