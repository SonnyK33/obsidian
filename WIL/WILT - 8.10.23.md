This one hurts because we bought in mid 50s, held through low 40s and then exited back in the mid-50s. The bonds are now ~60, with the 26s having done even better. I think if we had no position, when the SATS news came, I would have looked hard to buy 29s or especially 26s. Even though it doesn't change the situation, there was $2bn of liquidity up for grabs. The 24/26 differential already made no sense. The lesson is that the value trap of the 29s wasn't only painful to watch as it fell 10 pts, but it had reverberations elsewhere. It affected my objectivity. I don't feel bad about selling the 29s because the story on the TMUS option was also being disseminated. The risk of the unsecureds getting primed via the intercompany loan is still there. And the backdrop is dangerous. The mistake was not buying more 26s when the SATS news came. $2bn decreased the odds that they couldn't handle the 26s.

This should be an input to liquidity models. It's a volatility measure and so it mean-reverts. When it's "low", you should expect it to spike upwards, and not be long risk assets (and vice versa).
