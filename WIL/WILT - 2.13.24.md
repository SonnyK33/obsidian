NBR stock looks cheap vs the credit. You need to be very bearish on rig count to justify the market cap. There could be a long equity/short credit trade. 

The European REIT hybrid market looks interesting. Some names could increase equity value, increase FFO, and give comfort to hybrid holders by engaging in LME. That would require secured bank debt, equity issuance, or asset sales. 

It's so much easier losing money than making it. We made good money on SBNY, but it was a lot of work. We lost a lot on GLOBAU, and it took 30 seconds of stupidity.
