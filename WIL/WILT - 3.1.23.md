**Title**

NRG, a utility, and Vivint, a smart home company, are combining. The premise of the transaction is to cross-sell services. I don't have any strong views on the credit, but this will continue to be a trend. I remember writing a report on "smart homes'" in the 6th grade (27 years ago). It's crazy that this is just now going mainstream.
