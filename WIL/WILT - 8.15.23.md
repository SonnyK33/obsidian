[[Framework]]

Bob Elliott points out that China could sell treasuries to defend their currency. CNY has continued to depreciate, and is now close to 7.3, the late 2022 high. This would be tantamount to doubling QT. Brad Setser though argues that China has hundreds of billions of foreign assets outside of official reserves that they could sell rather than touch treasuries. Most of this is held at state commercial banks. The current account is also generating $500bn a year, which the government could attempt to mobilize. That would require them to convince exporters to stop hoarding dollars though. 

Another thread explains the CNY policy since 2008. As detailed in [[Trade Wars are Class Wars]], post-GFC, China lost its export markets and so shifted to domestic infrastructure and supply side stimulus. During this period they allowed their currency to appreciate. Eventually they gave up on this. Maybe it was due to realizing that there weren't sufficient profitable domestic investment opportunities? Then they reverted to focusing on exports when they devalued in 2015. They faced outflows as a consequence though, as wealthy Chinese took out their money even with a haircut. Since 2022, they've been waiting for the US to stop hiking and maybe even cut. The gap in rates has grown, and now they have to decide whether to defend their currency. The 10 year rates crossed in late 2022, when the US 10Y surged above 2.5%. 

IFF
How does IFF fit into framework?
This is a BBB- credit facing a possible downgrade. There aren't liquidity issues, and there is reasonable equity value. The equity call is ITM (high delta), and time to expiry is long (high vega and low gamma). A downgrade would increase the cost of future debt, hence increasing the volatility of FCF and unambiguously lowering asset value. What will they do to avoid this? The framework says they will seek to increase asset value, while keeping volatility high. They won't cut dividends (which would increase asset value but also lower volatility). Asset sales will increase asset value, but won't lower the volatility of recurring FCF (except those generated from the assets sold)
