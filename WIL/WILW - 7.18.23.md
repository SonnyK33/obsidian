**Title**

Turkey
They've chosen to accumulate reserves (sterilizing inflows) at the expense of letting the currency depreciate. This makes sense in the short-term as it reduces short-term default risk. The devalued currency has also helped the current account. The downside of this policy is that it's resulted in higher inflation. They're trying to mitigate this by increasing the minimum wage.  

Lumen
Similar to Altice, they have to convert customers to lower margin cloud and fiber based businesses before maturities are due. They have more time than Altice, but it's arguably harder to convert enterprise customers. Some people are separating the different boxes and arguing that Lumen could file without bringing down Level 3. The businesses seem too inter-linked to allow that. 

How to analyze a credit like this? In mass markets, there's two trajectories - the growth of fiber and the decline of copper broadband. There's less disclosure in the Business segment, but the goal is the same - to convert clients to newer technologies. I don't want to be taking a bet on the ability of management to execute. That needs to be broken down into different possibilities, and measured against constraints.
