1) IG template

For high grade credits, consensus is more likely to be correct. An analyst can add value by examining management intentions around capital allocation policies and look for non-linear risks. Is there big customer concentration risk? IG credits typically have long bonds, so a short-risk trade can be put on via a steepener which doesn't require a liquidity constraint (as you do in HY typically). 

1) China property

The sector has been decimated from developers defaulting and failing to make deliveries to consumers on time. In China, buyers typically start making payments before moving in, and delayed deliveries have hurt sentiment and decreased demand. Monetary stimulus is useless when domestic demand isn't there. Moving from an investment to a consumption model faces real constraints as it requires shifting power from businesses and local governments to individuals.
