Pharmacies can be valued on a per prescription basis. Roughly $10-20 per script. This is due to the recurring nature of prescriptions. Most drugs are for older people and for chronic conditions. 

Chemical sector can be separated into commodity and  speciality companies. The former uses oil or gas to produce intermediary chemicals which are the raw inputs for speciality companies. Commodity companies compete on unit cost economics and so supply capacity is the main driver.
