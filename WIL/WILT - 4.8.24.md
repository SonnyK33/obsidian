MOVIBZ could have been bad. This has happened before, and I need to ensure it doesn't happen again. If I don't love the fundamentals, it's not a pricing exercise; just pass on it. In this case, there was risk of continued negative FCF and declining liquidity. Everything has a price, yes. However, new deals are catalysts and mean new investors are looking at the credit. My framework which focuses on key questions and sets aside those which the market has answered for now, should take this into account. The existing curve is a useful data point of course. But it's wrong to think the market has settled at this level. I wasn't pricing off the existing bond because it's a stub, and rather was using the holdco bond. However, when a new deal comes, and especially if it goes badly, new investors will reprice that curve. Which is what's happened here. The holdco bond is now close to 8% but is 86 cash price. The opco (new bond) is 8.6% on 97. It still looks cheap to the holdco, but it's not the only opco, and there could be more going on. 

Given these issues, we should never have participated. And when they moved guidance wider, that should've been the cue. We definitely should not have put in for 30m. We escaped thanks to a warning from BTG, but we bought 2m thinking the reaction was a little overdone. A negative barclays piece came out today, and the bond is down close to another point. Why go through these headaches-- I should have just passed. Also, remember that new par bonds are great shorting vehicles. 

Mistake - want to price every deal, and using the curve as a data point
why did I do that - it's good to be a partner and price new deals, and the existing curve is useful
why that's wrong - new deals will reprice the curve, and so if I have issues with the fundamentals, the existing curve isn't a good gauge. We also don't need to play bad deals. 
correction - first you don't have to price everything. Second, if there are issues with the fundamentals, remember that new people will look at this, and they could reprice the curve. It's not a good anchor. 
why this works - always start with fundamentals for HY credits, even BB's. The curve will get repriced, so it's circular to use it as an anchor. Not playing every deal also shows we're disciplined.
