China is taking a much more active role in EM debt restructurings. In Zambia, it's pushing for local currency debt to be included in the restructuring and for official creditors (IMF/World Bank) to take losses as well. China is now the largest lender to developing countries, and so its likely to take an increasingly prominent role. Yellen critiized China for delaying the Zambia restructuring. The US has repeatedly crticized China for delaying restructurings and supposedly unfair lending terms. Contrary to the Western potrayal, China's demands seem more fair and better for the debtor. This also highlights the IMF/World Bank's (and the US) declining importance to the developing world.
