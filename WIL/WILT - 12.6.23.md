We met with Medley Advisors a while back on Japan and China. They thought that the BoJ will defend the JPY at 150, but could still hit 160 before that.  If it's at 155 in December, they'll remove the negative rate policy. This will affect corporate refinancing at some point. The defense budget is set to double in the next five years. The government tried to do without raising taxes, but the Japanese public actually wanted to pay higher taxes rather than borrowing.
