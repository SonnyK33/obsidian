Yesterday I wrote that I didn't understand Pettis' argument that if foreign entities' demand for treasuries isn't impacting the US borrowing cost. I think his argument is that foreign capital inflows  leads to more debt and more supply, and so can't lead to higher yields. If flows stop, does that require US treasury issuance to decrease? I think the chain of logic is that fewer inflows means a weaker dollar which transfers wealth and income to consumers. It should lead a stronger export sector, less unemployment (though that's already low), and lower fiscal deficits, hence less debt. Even if unemployment doesn't go down further, salaries should rise, which should generate more tax revenue, hence lower fiscal deficits. 

How would this be different if the US had a fixed exchange rate, along with open capital markets? That would mean it was fixed when capital flows were coming in as well. That would imply that the US sterilizes flows; that is, they'd buy the RMB flows, and issue more dollar debt. 

Broader question is how does a reduction in capital flows force a smaller trade deficit? The dollars generated abroad from US imports have to be spent somewhere. If they aren't spent on US treasuries, or kept in bank reserves, they'll be spent on US exports, hence reducing the current account and trade deficit. 


Breaking down national income accounting again. 
Income approach:
Y = C + I + G + (X-M)

Expenditure approach:
Y = C + S + T

C + I + G + (X-M) = C + S + T
I + G + NX = S + T
(S - I) + (T-G) = NX

If capital surplus goes down, trade deficit also goes down (NX goes up). Then either (S-I) goes up; that is, savings goes up (consumption falls), investment decreases, or budget surplus increases (deficit decreases). With a weaker exchange rate, consumption would likely fall (savings increase) and investment would decrease. So an increase in private savings will absorb some of the change. The rest will come from a smaller budget deficit and less treasury issuance.
