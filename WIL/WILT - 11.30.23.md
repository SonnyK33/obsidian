**China MS Meeting**
They don't expect a large fiscal stimulus, largely due to Xi's preferences. They're forecasting 8-9m units of housing demand per year. Prices are down 20-30% from their peak, and they're forecasting a 5-6% volume decline next year. There's 5 years' of inventory, but that includes some houses that should be written off as they won't be occupied. Second homes require 70-80% down payments. They recommended one China equity (if you're bullish) - Nora Technology. They advised to stay from cutting edge tech companies as they may get sanctioned.
