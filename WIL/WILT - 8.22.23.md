**Argentina Dollarization**
A surprisingly strong showing for Javier Milei has brought up the idea of dollarizing Argentina to force fiscal responsibility. A good article by the former head of Ecuador's central bank explains why dollarization doesn't solve the underlying issues. 

He gives five lessons from Ecuador's experience:
1) It does bring down inflation (almost by definition)
2) It doesn't require fiscal contraction. Ecuador continued to run deficits funded by current account surpluses (oil exports), external financing (from China), and defaulting on external debt. The central bank also started monetizing fiscal debts by issuing domestic liabilities to the treasury (backed by dollar reserves, I'm assuming). 
3) It doesn't imply economic growth. This should be obvious, as dollarization stifles the ability to stimulate the economy with fiscal spending. 
4) It makes the economy more vulnerable to shocks. Again, this is obvious. A flexible exchange rate allows an economy to react to challenging conditions with a weaker exchange rate. This boosts exports. You're even more vulnerable if you're a commodity exporter. Following Pettis' argument in Volatility Machine, income and debt servicing needs are now correlated. When the dollar rises, oil prices tend to fall. Your exchange rate is less competitive, and your oil revenue falls at the same time. 
5) The economy becomes less competitive unless the labour market is allowed to adjust. If the exchange rate can't adjust, wages need to. In Ecuador, minimum wages have risen. This explains why dollarization would be a bad idea for Argentina. Poor economic and political institutions (including excessive deficits or insufficient tax revenue), will result in inflation for countries that issue in their own currency or low growth and unemployment for countries that are dollarized and don't have flexible labour markets. 

Pettis argues that Ecuador's dollarization and fiscal mismanagement correlated with abundant global liquidity. Capital inflows into Ecuador imply rising current account deficits. 

M - X = (I - S) -Â (T - G)

This implies that investment rises relative to savings or fiscal deficits rise. These both imply that consumption rises. If there are productive investments, this is fine. Otherwise, it results in wasted consumption or non-productive investments. I need to go through mechanics here. Dollarization may slow this, as a country receiving flows won't have an appreciating currency which will further stimulate consumption. Even still, Pettis' point is that dollarization can be overwhelmed by inflows, as was the case in Ecuador and Argentina's 1991 Convertibility Plan. If they dollarize, they need to control capital inflows. 


Pozsar on BRICS
There was a long FT article on how middle income countries are increasingly assertive as they can play the US and China (among others) against each other. Zoltan had a throwaway comment that the BRICS will no longer recycle their surpluses into treasuries. He's been on the opposite side of this debate with Pettis, who's been arguing against any kind of BRICS alliance or their ability to move away from the dollar without dramatically changing the structure of global trade flows. Pettis argues in this thread that Pozsar misunderstands all of this, which may be right. The part I'm not sure about is where he says that less foreign buying of treasuries won't affect rates. He says that since US investment needs are not constrained by high savings, the capital inflows must reduce net savings or increase US debt. That makes sense. He goes on to say that this means that they can't increase the demand for treasuries relative to supply. That feels intuitively wrong, but I can't tell why.
