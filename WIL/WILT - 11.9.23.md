Kenya still hasn't refinanced their 2024s. While they appear to have the funds, it's clear that they don't like what the market is offering. 

Sunnova is very unlikely to be a buyout candidate as they don't generate any FCF. The stock price would need to fall by ~75% to make the math work. 

Now is the time to offer creating financing solutions to distressed situations.
