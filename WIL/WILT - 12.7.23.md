What's my goal at work? I want to develop frameworks to distill complex situations into simple to understand trades. All ideas need to be broken into macro and idiosyncratic trades. For macro trades, you need to explain why this credit will be affected more when the catalyst hits. Examples include low FCF/liquidity, high financial/operating leverage, and targeting a segment of the market likely to get hit first. Idiosyncratically driven credits should have a catalyst that's one of capital allocation (e.g. high capex spend), sectoral changes (e.g. seniors shifting to Medicare Advantage which lowers margins for hospitals), or LME actions (e.g. risk of drop-down transactions).

**Idiosyncratic**
Given the above catalyst types, we can back-solve to find potential credits. 
*Capital Allocation*
- where is capex spending expected to change
- who has a large dividend and will have trouble cutting it (more of an IG issue, but could be relevant)

*Sectoral Changes*
- comes from top-down sector views

*LME*
- who has liquidity issues and large maturity walls


1) Is macro story improving?
	1) Impact on topline
	2) impact on costs
	3) net impact on EBITDA
2) What are the range of scenarios for topline and costs over the next 3 years
3) What are the range of scenarios of EBITDA/FCF given those scenarios
4) What is consensus view, and are spreads sufficient for range of outcomes?
	1) benchmarking against other credits may be useful here
