FHLB banks are quasi-government entities set up to support commercial bank mortgage lending activities. Executives are compensated on the basis of assets (e.g. head of SF HLB made $2.4m last year). The program manages $1.5 trillion, but only 350m went towards affordable housing. They functionally provide liquidity to big banks, even though those aren't the major originators of mortgages. 

There was a story on Friday that AMZN was in talks with wireless operators to offer services to its prime customers. Negotiating an MVNO with the big 3 (VZ, T, TMUS) would be tough, as they wouldn't want a new player to undercut their retail business. They're also not under any obligation to open up their network (operators in Europe have had to open up their fixed line / FTTH grids since the 1990s). US ARPUs are much higher than in Europe ($45 vs 11 in Germany), which may be incentivizing tech to get involved. DISH is the only major spectrum owner who would be incentivized to sell services to AMZN, but their network will only cover 70% of the country by 6/23. TMUS by contrast covers the whole country with 5G.

DISH uses Open RAN (as does RAKUTEN in Japan) which is untested and may have contributed to delays in rollout.

**Savings Rate**
Colombia has a high current account deficit. However, it's completely financed by FDI, and is a consequence of a high investment rate (and a stable government) relative to low domestic savings. The debits which decrease the current account come from profits earned by foreign companies operating in Colombia. Most of these profits are reinvested as FDI, neutralizing the flow. 


China now accounts for 25% of leading edge cancer drugs, from 10% in 2017. The number of drugs originated from China has gone from 300 to 1,200 in that period. Astra Zeneca has defied the current cold war with China to look for M&A opportunities there and to work with local scientists.
