WILT
Hybrids are an interesting market. Issuers get 50/50 equity credit, and this drives their decision marking on LME. We spoke to AroundTown, a German real estate company today, and asked them about taking out their hybrids. These instruments are trading in the 40s-60s with high coupon expense. Issuing secured debt to take them out would help with FFO. Many of their peers have done just that. However, unlike their peers, ARNDT has >$4bn of hybrids, and even if they take out a small amount of one issue, they all lose their equity credit. If that were to happen, their LTV would increase from 41% to 55%. That would weigh on the cost of their secured debt, as well as the equity which is already trading well below book. I also learned that ARNDT is technically not a REIT, and that term is used loosely in Europe. 

From reading a BAML piece on HEIBOS, however, S&P did not take away of the equity credit as a tender was within an allowed amount. S&P capped tenders at 10% per year and 25% over 10 years. So the executive at ARNDT may have misspoke, or there may be other nuances.
