The entire podcast ad market is only $2bn. That really surprised me. The total digital ad market in the US is above $200bn. Fragmentation of the market is the main impediment, I assume. According to IHRT, podcasts have much more engagement with other digital media, as 80% of people finish what they're listening to. This will change over time as the market professionalizes. The niche nature of podcasts should make them ripe for advertisers. 

IHRT equity seems very cheap on conventional metrics. The credit is obviously distressed with the 27s trading at 50. If we think they'll make it and have a good year, is the stock a buy with a near 100% FCF yield. You need to adjust the multiple for the discounts the bonds are trading at. The equity needs to viewed as a pure OTM. The FCF flowing to equity argument is tougher when bankruptcy risk is high and bonds are trading at such low levels. It's also likely to be very volatile, reducing the sharpe of the trade.
