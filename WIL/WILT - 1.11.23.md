WILT
There's still too much residential real estate inventory in China. Even with the reopening, falling house prices may deter may people from buying. The excess inventory will absorb the natural demand. The market will need to see more fundamental improvements (meaning more consumer demand) before new buyers enter the market for bonds. On the funding topic, fed funds versus IG spread is in the second percentile. You can't own the index if you're levered. The USD's role as the global reserve currency is being diminished by the split between the US and China and was accelerated by the US confiscating Russia's UST holdings. Less demand for UST will make it harder for the US to finance deficits and will neccessitate less spending or higher tax revenues. At the same time, defense spending is likely to increase. So spending cuts will have to come from somewhere. The entitlements - medicare/medicaid and social security - will be up for discussion.  A comprehensive overhaul of the healthcare system (say to a single payer model) is very unlikely in the short-term but may become increasingly popular. The US spends more than all other countries on healthcare. This is negative for hospitals and manged care comapnies. Stifel economist argued the Fed may start YCC like Japan and will issue more bills than long-term bonds. He argued this was good for equities (I guess because of negative real rates?) and definitely good for gold. At the same time as the UST will be losing buyers, inflation vol is likely to increase. Inflation volatility leads to more inflation which further icnreased volatility and so on. Higher inflation vol means higher term permia and higher long-term yields. That's what happened in the 1960s/70s (check this). So UST will be wider and steeper?



Narrative
All eyes on the CPI number tomorrow. Stocks are up in anticipation of the continuing trend of disinflation. Gold continues to rise on recession fears and pivot hope while oil has started to reverse YTD decline.
