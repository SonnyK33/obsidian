Indian savings rate is too low, and they should allow the currency to depreciate. [[Indian Savings Rate]]

Earnings Expectations
CZR rallied hard into earnings which were in-line. Management indicated that they were close to de-levering, but wouldn't start shareholder friendly actions until next year. Bonds were down. We were right to not cover into earnings. When the narrative has been strong, and asset prices have rallied hard into earnings, the bar is very high. In most cases, any deviation from the script will result in longs selling and shorts covering. Trading into earnings is very risky and counter-intuitive. 

Mexcat
A total miss on our part. I missed a headline when I was out, and the team failed to highlight either. But the core mistake was I deviated from my process. Why was it trading where it was post the rumours of a takeover? Because the market didn't fully believe it would happen. This trade only made sense if we had more conviction than the market; that is, if we trusted the government would follow through. We didn't trust the government, but did the trade anyways. This was not good research.
