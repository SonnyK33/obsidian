I'm trying to determine what to read next and where to focus my attention. 

I think all of my reading interests are centered on economic and political history. I'm trying to understand why some countries develop the way they do. Why do some follow certain growth models, and others follow different ones.  

How does history influence your growth model? China evolved in a certain way because it achieved land reform and redistributed wealth away from local landlords and power brokers. India never did this. 

What is the ideal economy? Does it depend on the specific preferences of its people or is there a universal best? 



How does history influence a country’s ideal economy? Does it change the universe of alternatives for a given country?

My goal is to develop a framework for looking sovereigns. How to fix a bad economy? What is the flow chart of questions and proposals? How to fix Argentina, Nigeria, and Venezuela, for example? This can then be coupled with security analysis, to determine what's being priced in. Based on constraints and a thorough understanding of a country's model, can I make predictions of what it will do next? Can I use that to come up with trade ideas?

The things I've read this year that had the biggest influence on my thinking are: [[Bernanke on Savings Glut]], [[The Long, Slow Death of Global Development - American Affairs Journal]], [[Trade Wars are Class Wars]], [[Geopolitical Alpha]]. Pettis' work tied together internal and external balances. What I'm still curious about is what leads to different internal balances? The history of how the external balances evolved over time and their influence on foreign policy is also very interesting. The book I'm currently reading on Vienna talks about how a long period of calm and profit-taking led to imbalances and WW1. 

Related to these issues, how does mass politics, and public perception affect politics. The [[The Dean of Shandong]] had some interesting points. Narrative Economics is on my list for this topic. 


There's many regions and countries I want to learn more about:
- Russia (revolution, cold war - Lippman, and earlier history)
- Germany and Prussia (from Holy Roman Empire until WW1 and Weimar Republic)
- India (ancient history, Mughal period, economics of East India Company, the post-Gandhi period, where did Modi come from?)
- Latin America (economic policy)
- China (its growth model)



Some ideas:
gerchenko (Ukrainian), rodrik 
Monetary and fiscal History of Latin American 
Hirschman and polyani seem more fundamental 
Kindelburger after that 
Table of contents for that development article 
More books on China and how it developed 
How did Korea develop ?
How Asia Works
