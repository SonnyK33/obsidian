WILT
There's an exodus of people from Brazil's coastal cities to the interior as agriculture becomes a major part of the economy. Luis Eduardo MagalhÃ£es, a town 1000km inland from Salvador is now a hub of soybean production, the majority of which go to China.

Braskem
Bonds down ~1pt on the long-end today. Lesson, as always is, if there's been a strong trend going into earnings, the bar is very high. It was the reverse of the CZR situation.

DISH
The 29s, annoyingly were up another 4 pts today, and are now >60. This is surprising as the SATS acquisition doesn't come close to solving liquidity issues. If anything, it just opens the door to more spending. Ex ante, I think it was the right decision, as they could have easily said they'll be exercising the T-Mobile option or hinted at other actions for the 2024s. If they issue a new secured which primes the unsecureds with respect to the intercompany loan, that greatly eats into recovery. The best trade would have been to swap into the 26s.
