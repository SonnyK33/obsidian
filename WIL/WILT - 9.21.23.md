When looking at Volcan, a Peruvian miner whose bonds fell 20 pts last week, I realized only 2-3 things matter in these types of situations. 
First, why is it trading here? As always, this is the most important question to answer. Does that reason make sense?
I've found for EM stressed/HY, the reason is more likely to be a poor one, versus US HY. So if a US HY bond falls 15 pts in one day, there's often a good reason for that. The financials are known, the equity may be widely held, and there's more liquidity. For EM situations, any or all three of those factors could be missing. So an EM bond dropping 15 pts in one day, is more likely to be a good long trade than a US one, all things equal. 

Second, does the business make money on an unlevered basis. If the answer is no, you're underwriting equity risk. If the answer is yes, how much interest can the EBITDA-Capex serve?

Third, what's the right price. Here's where valuation comes in. What multiple are you buying the asset at? Combine this with the interest analysis above. Throw in all funds needed as secured obligations above your bond, and calculate the creation multiple.
