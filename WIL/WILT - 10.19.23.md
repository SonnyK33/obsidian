Venezuela
The US has relieved sanctions on Venezuela, making it possible for us to trade VENZ/PDVSA bonds again. I did some rough math on how much their export revenue would be at current prices and if production went half way back to 2016 levels. If you assume imports also return to pre-sanction levels (plus inflation), you'd still have a surplus allowing you to pay a ~6% coupon on external debt + PDI. The math is rough but indicates that large haircuts may not be required.
