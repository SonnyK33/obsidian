WILT
You can track system wide liquidity with SOMA - TGA - RRP (per Felix Jauvin). This index is basically flat since the start of Q4 which coincides with the market trading in a range. Going forward, SOMA will be decreasing (per QT), TGA can't increase materially until the debt ceiling negotiations are restarted (though will get a boost with the House speaker election), and RRP will continue to attract flows as RRP rates are above 1m t-bills. If the market starts to discount the chance of cuts this year, that will push up t-bill rates closer to the terminal rate and cause outflows from the RRP which would be an increase in liquidity. All signs are that debt ceiling negotiations will be difficult and political.

The post-covid fiscal stimulus led to a credit boom that is continuing. As deposits are sticky, higher rates have allowed banks to increase NIM's. This incentivized banks to increase lending. High wages, low unemployment, and still strong consumer balance sheets have also made it easy for banks to continue lending. All of this means the Fed's actions so far wil not be enough to bring down demand and inflation. 

#PFSI is a mortgage servicer with a skew towards purchasers (over refi's) and government originations (which are higher quality). This could be one to buy at the bottom.

Narrative
Looks like a continuation of last week - lots of IG suppy, equities up, rates up, and gold's up. Crude's continuing Friday move, though there was a story that Biden rejected offers to refill the SPR, as the price was too high. Powell and CPI will be the focus this week after a hot job print last week.
