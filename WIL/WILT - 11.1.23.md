WILT
Israel's GDP could contract by 10% according to JPM. There are more and more predictions of a regional war. While I think that's unlikely, as the assault on Gaza continues, it becomes more probable. The Jordanians withdrew their ambassador from Israel. The US' support for Israel isn't unlimited, though it's close. They don't want a regional war and definitely don't want US troops stationed in Palestine. 

CYH
Community Health IR head said delays in A/R were from late billings, caused by internal system upgrades, and not a deteriorating consumer. He also said though that the shift towards Medicare Advantage is based on several trends, including fears of a recession. MA plans include vision and dental and don't have an out-of-pocket limit. MA plans are administered by private insurance companies (UNH and HUM for example), and their popularity is also driven by seniors' fears around the sustainability of Medicare (though Medicare reimburses these private companies for providing insurance). The private insurers administering these programs typically pay 80-90% of claims; presumably vanilla Medicare pays 100%. This change in payor mix has been weighing on CYH's margins. 

Antitrust issues around selling hospitals has also become an issue. The CEO said that many sales that occurred since 2017 wouldn't happen with today's FTC. 


PDVSA
It looks like there are two separate processes for Citgo/PDVSA. Crystallex won a judgement which is leading to a sale process for PDV, the US sub of PDVSA, and the owner of Citgo. At the same time, PDVSA 2020 holders are trying to enforce a lien against Citgo after a judge ruled that PDVSA defaulted. The Treasury department has so far continued to protect Citgo from creditors, and extended this until January. PDVSA 2020 holders have two avenues to monetization. If PDV is sold, the buyer would likely want to take out the PDVSA 2020 lien. Alternatively, bondholders may be able to foreclose on 50.1% of Citgo shares if 1) the court upholds the earlier decision that the lien is valid and 2) Treasury grants a license to transfer shares. 

It will be difficult for the Treasury to continue blocking this, since it was part of the original sanctions against Maduro, which they're now dropping. There is a chance that the court rules against bondholders and the lien is invalidated. This is seen as unlikely. 

One risk I'm thinking about is that Citgo's value comes from its relationship with PDVSA. The whole point of dropping sanction is to increase Venezuelan oil production, and lower the prices for refined products in the US. The Biden administration may continue to protect Citgo until there is comprehensive restructuring if they think that's the best way to get Venezuelan crude back online.

Loyalty Programs
Spirit and Hawaiian Airline loyalty plan-backed bonds have fallen to >20% yields. Neither is a major airline or part of an alliance. WFS analyst is arguing that has materially degraded the value of the collateral and LTVs on those are now > 100%. Spirit may default if the deal with JBLU doesn't go through and Hawaiian Airlines has been hit by the wildfires.
