Bloomberg: Indiaâ€™s Doctors Rebel Against Generic Drug Mandate: Prognosis (8/29/23)

Germany
Per Adam Tooze, support for the right-wing has risen in Germany, and that's being driven by a single issue - refugees. National identity is increasingly an issue for Germans who are worried about crime and presumably the economic impact of refugees. 

**Brazil**
Lula has entered into an agreement with members of right-wing parties in order to form a governing coalition. He'll give up cabinet posts in exchange for his legislative agenda. This signals his willingness to compromise on certain issues and removes the left tail of certain "anti-business" policies. 

**Chips**
Due to the ongoing US-China conflict over semiconductors, China may give more support to domestic manufacturers of chipmaking machines. The FT highlighted Naura Technology and Advanced Micro-Fabrication Equipment Inc.

**Russian LNG**
Europe is still dependent on Russian LNG, and that is unlikely to change unless demand comes down. The FT quotes the Eurasia Group who says Europe will need to cut gas consumption by 10-15%. Russian LNG accounts for 16% of the EU's total imports and has been exempted from sanctions so far. Storage containers are almost full ahead of the winter, but there are still fears around supply disruptions. The largest supplier is the US who will likely grow their share in the coming years. 

**China - Pharma sector**
There is a growing anti-corruption drive in China. As discussed in [[The Dean of Shandong]], these moves tend to be popular with the people even if they're described by Western media as anti-business. The government has been alarmed by the increases in drug prices (2x in 7 years), and interactions between pharmaceutical companies and doctors. Interestingly, there's a similar push in India. The push back from doctors there follows a similar line; crackdowns on interactions between industry and doctors will hamper innovation. China accounts for 13% of AZN revenue, and I believe is the main market for one of BHC's drugs. #BHC
