A good thread on the lack of lay-offs in the construction sector (https://twitter.com/SteveMiran/status/1617239573687578624). The key takeaway is that the government's infrastructure spending may be making this corner of the labour market even tighter. Builders may be reluctant to fire workers given the increased spending. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will bring ~$40bn in federal spending for construction/infrastructure in 2023 and $54 billion next year. 

Argentine buybacks may be a tactic by the government to boost the exchange rate ahead of the election. 


The Vaca Muerta will be a game changer in Argentina. The Nestor Kirchner pipeline will be completed by June and will generate import savings of $2.5bn. This will increase as other projects are completed and they are able to increase oil and natural gas exports. 
Dollar amortizations are low this year and next ($2bn and 5bn respectively). They increase to 10bn in 2025, but assuming there's a new government in power, and fiscal deficits are cut, this should be manageable. CDS is pricing in a 90% chance of defaulting within 3 years and assumes policy continuity. Current yields will be stepping up. The 2016 indenture front-end bonds may have the most upside. The 30s also amortize and so you're getting 9.5 points in P+I in 1.5 years. 

Key question is whether this government will lose the election and the extent of any fiscal adjustment. How much of an adjustment is possible?

They have ways to manage their reserve position. They can cut dollar allocations to imports (which?), issue dollar futures, others? They can continue printing money to avoid a local default. 


The Fed is now treating RRP and bank reserves as fungible for liquidity purposes. That is, it's willing to continue QT even bank reserves run low. The logic is that banks can simply raise deposit rates to pull funds from the RRP (depositors would withdraw from MMFs and move them to deposits). Along with this, they announced they're willing to continue QT even if they have to cut rates. The main implication of this change is higher deposit rates and lower NIMs for banks. This will hurt bank earnings and lower future lending (which is the point).



Narrative
Stocks are up and yields are up. This fits with the soft landing / higher for longer narrative. This looks unsustainable however as higher costs of debt will start to have an effect on fundamentals.  It's not hurting consumers yet as wages have been rising and unemployment is low.
