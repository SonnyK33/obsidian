WILT
China may be able to avoid "Japanification" as it learned from that example. Japan also allowed the Yen to appreciate in the 1990s and had a restrictive fiscal policy. The lack of capital controls also allowed for capital flight. In China, capital controls plus a state owned financial system make a banking crisis less likely. So far, property price declines also haven't approached Japan's levels. 

China may try dealing with local debt by either explicitly guaranteeing it, and deepening the market, or by removing the implicit guarantees and allow many to default. The government is also considering actions that will broaden revenue sources for municipalities so they don't have to rely on land sales. These could include property or inheritance taxes. There's a story that the government is looking to get credit ratings on an array of SOEs; that could pave the path for an eventual sale.
