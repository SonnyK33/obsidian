WILT
**DISH**
Ergen is merging his company with SATS, and in conjunction with that, trying to exercise an option to buy more spectrum from TMUS. In the merton framework, he's trying to increase the value of his call by increasing volatility. The equity has responded in kind. In that scenario, it doesn't make sense to be long credit. Our long Dish 29s were short vega given maturity and long gamma. The question is which will prevail. In a situation where management can keep pulling rabbits out of their hats (lots of assets, concentrated ownership), we should expect management to continue to increase volatility. The only long position that makes sense is equity. Assuming levels are reasonable, you should be short the credit (long vega).

**Contrasting with AMC**
Similar to DISH, AMC has upcoming liquidity issues. However, they have no levers to pull. There isn't any capex to cut, nor are there assets to lever. Gamma is low on the equity because it is far OTM; the only way to increase equity value is to increase volatility.
