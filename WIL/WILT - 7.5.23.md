China introduced curbs on germanium and gallium exports, which are key to chipmaking. Japan and South Korea are the largest importers of the metals and have warned that these actions will raise prices. This was to be expected given all of the US-led sanctions on China, preventing it from importing chip making equipment. 

Dollar Hegemony
Was declining US oil production a factor in Nixon abandoning the gold standard and moving to a fiat system? The fiat system, along with US military interventions, allowed the proliferation of petrodollars and cemented the USD as the reserve currency, even without gold backing it. Now that oil production is declining, what does that mean for the USD and petrodollars?

According to the BIS, since 2000, the share of USD in global reserves has gone from 70 to 58%. The gainers are all US satellites (Canada, Australia, Sweden, and Korea). For there to be de-dollarization, the surplus countries have to stop dumping excess savings into USD and may not be able to run current account surpluses. The US is unique in allowing other countries unlimited access to US equities, bonds, and real estate. The RMB could gain in stature, if the government opened up capital controls. That's unlikely as the government wouldn't want to see a large capital outflow. This is a key constraint for the Chinese government. 

Polyethylene spreads have come down on lower demand. BAKIDE and BRASKM would be the biggest  biggest losers from this.
