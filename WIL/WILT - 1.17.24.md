Write on SIVB
The new entity will consist of a liquidating trust and a newco. The seniors get 100% equity in the newco. The prefs will be equity for the liquidating trust and will have a lien on the newco. The main source of value in the trust is equity stakes and the holdco deposit. The source of value in the newco is the NOLs from the failed business. The value of the equity that the prefs are given will depend on how much debt is ahead of them, that is, how much is given to the seniors. The holders of seniors are also holders of prefs. Since prefs are trading at 1-2, we think senior holders will push for a higher valuation of the newco, which will give them fewer shares of the liquidating trust, and hence more value for the prefs. 


Lessons on Global Automotive
It's good to do due diligence, but if you push the deal on covenants, expect full size. It's a way to demonstrate knowledge and add value, but then you are fully pregnant with the deal.
