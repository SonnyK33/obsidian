WILT
Can I categorize trade types further, possibly by the type of analysis required. 
1) Liquidity constrained - Can the issuer refinance near-term maturities?
To-do's: 
- FCF sensitivity for different revenue scenarios
- Debt schedule
- how much liquidity do they have and what are potential funding sources?
- What are their levers? (asset sales, equity raises, cutting capex)
- Is a regular way financing possible? If so, at what level?
- Would the covenants allow for a drop-down or up-tiering?
- Would a reverse for a new deal make sense?
- What are possible outcomes and how would security pricing change (equity, bonds, CDS)


2) Recovery undervalued - Will securities recover more than market expecting?
To-do's:
- write out and describe the process underway (Chapter 11, FDIC process, etc) with milestones
- What does the pro-forma balance sheet look like (DIP loans, asset sales, etc)
- Calculate recovery across capital structure for different scenarios
- Are their similar credits? Including non-distressed ones whose value is based on similar assets?

3) Thematic short/long - Is there a specific industry/macro headwind/tailwind?
To-do's:
- What is the PnL opportunity for the given theme? (spread x duration x bonds o/s = $SxD)
- Identify best issuers to look at (likely the highest contributors to $SxD)
- Is this a macro or idiosyncratic trade? If the former, verify whether it will tighten/widen more than the index 
	- this could occur due to more leverage, less liquidity, or a lower attachment point given target market
- What are the FCF outcomes depending on how the theme plays out?
- Could it become a liquidity trade in one of the scenarios?
- If not, how would spreads react to different FCF outcomes?
	- look at similar issuers in a lower ratings bucket


HY Opportunities:
1) Trade types - thematic (based on these questions), new deals (including reverses), and opportunistic (event-driven based on newsflow, corporate actions, etc)
	1) Thematic - based on above opportunity sizing
	2)  What are potential new issues?
	3) Opportunistic are hard to predict ahead of time

IG Opportunities:
1) BBB-/BB+ names that could go in one direction or another (VISTA, NRG, RCI, WBA, Chem names)

EM Opportunities:
1) Sovereigns - need to articulate framework
2) Corps
	1) Distressed opportunities that have become illiquid but are large and could provide asymmetric opportunities (ODEBRE, SAMMIN, etc)
	2) Extensions of HY thematic trades (AZUL)
