**Fiber Spend**
Subsidies for fiber buildout from the IRA were thought to be supportive of telco operators. However, it may encourage capex in some areas where the target population is poorer and less willing to pay high ARPUs. This will be most negative for FYBR and LUMEN. The policy's split between FWA and fiber is also not clear. FWA scores well with businesses, which poses a threat to enterprise fiber products, like those offered by Lumen. It's also a lower price point and many SMB's have lighter data needs (e.g. no video streaming). 

The funding from the IRA (BEAD) is also increasing labour costs in the industry and increasing the per home cost of fiber. 

**Pakistan**
Delays in the coming election may go beyond the 2024 bond maturity. That may increase the pressure to pay it off. However, given the deteriorating fiscal regime, it could hurt debt sustainability. The country has been financing itself with short-term local debt and floaters. While that takes pressure off reserves, it means that fiscal deficits will continue. The high local yields (>20%) resulting from the fiscal trajectory has crowded out private investment.
