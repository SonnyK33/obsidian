WILT
China and BoP
On the Odd Lots podcast, Barry Eichengreen, said that if China reduces its treasury holdings, that won't necessarily translate to lower deficits in the US (as Pettis argues). I think this point was that China (and Saudi and others whose foreign policies goals are shifting) can deploy funds elsewhere - developing countries, BRI, etc. Foreign investment has broadened, and so it's isn't so clear-cut anymore. 

GS Call
Turkish economist said Turkey will need $15bn from external sources to pay for the fiscal expansion needed to offset the monetary contraction. Where will that come from? Saudis have been reluctant, and the UAE is only doing so through energy projects.
