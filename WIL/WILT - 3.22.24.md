WILT
Altice France is trading at distressed levels after Drahi changed his mind on inorganic deleveraging and said bondholders will need to participate. Bonds have dropped across holdco and opcos. CDS references the secured bonds, and the curve is flat. 3s5s trades ~5 pts. The trade we decided on was a CDS steepener. Our view is that no one wants a default, especially Drahi, the only shareholder. In any of the likely scenarios - distressed exchange which buys runway or asset sales - the curve should steepen. Why is the curve this flat? Apparently there are a few large traders who have the steepener on, and they're being attacked.
