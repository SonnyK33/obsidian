WILT
I've been trying to extract some investment ideas from Mac. While he's not good at crunching numbers and doesn't understand financial statements or credit, he has some good big picture ideas. One that I think is interesting is how all US E&Ps are getting gassier. As basins mature, they become gassier. More gas also means lower domestic prices. Many analysts (including ourselves) lazily look at BOE. If an E&P is about to get much gassier, and that's not in the price, that could be interesting. The other dynamic is LNG; that's creating demand  for exports where the realized price is much higher. E&Ps that are close to export infrastructure may be able to get a better price than those who are further away. That spread will matter more and more as they become gassier. The other trade that could work is pipelines that are bringing gas to the export infrastructure. There will be more demand for their services as LNG becomes the dominant driver. The higher gas split plus the foreign demand, will make these pipelines valuable assets.
