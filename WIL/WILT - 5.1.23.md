HY bond indentures typically use a fixed charge coverage ratio. These covenants prevent the issuer from raising incremental debt it interest coverage exceeds a certain level- typically 2x. The higher rate environment dramatically cuts coverage ratios. For many credits, this will prevent them from issuing new debt without resorting to various priming mechanisms.
