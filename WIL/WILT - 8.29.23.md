Magellan Midstream's deal with Oneok is predicated on the expected boom in natural gas versus a slowdown or stagnation in crude and refined products. After the surge in infrastructure this past decade, there isn't much more to do. Oil demand is expected to peak with motorists switching to EV's over time.

Deflation is being driven by pork prices which are down 26% and which makes up the biggest piece of CPI. Pork prices fell due to supply and are expected to fall by less in August. There's also risks of car and rental costs coming down. Is there another path beyond consumption? This is clearly the Western consensus. If the deflation is constrained to the property sector, can this be managed. Young people appear to be cutting back, but it's not as clear cut for other groups. Why is consumption so important?

National income comes from investment, consumption, and trade surpluses (and government expenditures). Economic growth (without growing debt) then depends on increasing productive investment (i.e. investment which will grow GDP by at least as much as debt will increase), consumption, or trade surpluses. If Beijing is against growing consumption, as they want to avoid wasteful spending that pervades the West, they will need to grow productive investment, which will mean new technologies or trade surpluses. While the US is pushing countries to cut imports from China, I suspect this won't be changing any time soon. In fact, even though Chinese exports have shrank, imports have shrank by more. The recent surge in EV cars is the latest example of China's successful industrial policy. The alternative to consumption is more net exports (especially to developing world) and new technologies to improve productivity and which will lead to productive investments. Pettis in the FT article above says that.  

The RMB continues to depreciate given the rate differential. The PBOC is in a tough spot. They've been stimulating demand by cutting rates but that further devalues the currency. A devalued currency hurts consumption even further. If the currency depreciates too much, there could be capital flight as in 2015. 

ROIC
This is a key metric for value investors and one that I rarely pay attention to. It should give a sense of competitive advantage and management's ability  to allocate capital efficiently. Have been reading [[Thinking in Systems - WIP]] and I thought about how "invested capital" is clearly a stock and is the accumulation of previous inflows (EBIT) and outflows (debt service and dividends). How should it play into my [[Merton Model for Management Incentives]] framework? If ROIC > outflows , over time, invested capital should rise. That should equate to higher asset valuation (EV) as well though the relationship will depend on how the capital is allocated. If it's kept in cash, that will be a 1:1 increase in assets. From a credit perspective, the key question may be the degree to which management can increase invested capital given outflows. That is, what's the hurdle rate in terms of margins and revenue growth, and what does that imply for management incentives? If management can't grow invested capital due to heavy outflows, what should they do?
