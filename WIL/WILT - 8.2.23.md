**Broadcom**
Broadcom is acquiring software maker Vmware, and will have $70bn of debt when the deal closes. Broadcom sells semiconductor chips to a broad array of customers, the largest of which is wired broadband operators (cable and fiber). There's a lot of excitement around semiconductor chips these days, with AI applications expected to propel the industry forward. But the vast majority of Broadcom's chips are for ordinary applications (cars, mobile phones, networking, etc). The company they're acquiring, Vmware, sells virtualization software which helps enterprise users optimize their hardware. Roughly half of their revenue is recurring with the rest coming from new customers or upselling products. 

This deal is billed as a bet on secular shifts in technology. New chips and cloud technologies will fuel their growth. But when you dig in, these acquisition is a bet on enterprise customers continuing to upgrade their software and moving from on-premise to cloud based solutions. While that may be the overall trend, there is inherent cyclicality there. Businesses don't upgrade their software unless they have to, and certainly not when there's economic uncertainty. Many businesses have already moved to the cloud, and those that haven't, may not be in a rush to do so. There is an underlying assumption that the cloud is better, and everyone will eventually make the switch. But part of the cloud's appeal seems to fit with a go-go economy with lots of lean startups. Large enterprise customers may prefer to own their own hardware, or at the very least, may not be a in a rush to switch. 

**South Africa AIDS Conspiracy**
I read a thread on twitter spreading the story that AIDS may have been intentionally spread in South Africa during the 1980s and 1990s by intelligence services aiming to maintain White rule. While it sounds crazy, South African intelligence (in collaboration with the West) went to far  lengths (including trying to get nuclear weapons from Israel) to maintain control. It doesn't seem crazy to me that some wing of the organization would spread a disease that would hurt the Black population if they could. A former South African mercenary is the source for a similar story in the Guardian. As I went down the rabbit hole, there was also a story that the same South African group (South African Institute for Maritime Research) was involved (along with the CIA and MI6) to assassinate the UN Secretary General, Hammarskjold. He was flying to the Congo to mediate a crisis, and was opposed to the interests of the US and Belgium. It's not hard to connect the dots - in a bid to gain support for their mission in the Congo, the US and UK overlooked (or supported) SAIMR's actions in South Africa. This much is already known; the US, UK, and Israel were the last supporters of the Apartheid regime. The extent of that support likely isn't fully known yet.

This story plus yesterday's about the coups in Niger and Burkina Faso have rekindled my interest in the legacies of colonialism in Africa.
