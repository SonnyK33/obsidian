**Turkey**
Turkey's balance of payment crisis is similar to the currency crisis Mexico went through in 1994. Mexico issued dollar-denominated local debt to gain credibility, which ended up increasing their FX debt load and turned the currency crisis into a credit crisis. Turkey similarly guaranteed the exchange rate on TRY deposits and has borrowed heavily from commercial banks. the one thing going for Turkey is most debt is owed domestically (even FX debt) in the form of dollar deposits. The government may be able to impose capital controls or restrictions on dollar deposits and prioritize payments on Eurobonds. The banks look like a good short in any scenario - either they have a crisis/default or they punish the banks which are the central banks' largest creditor. 

**Trades**
Sometimes we focus too much on free or cheap options and ignore the harder but potentially more lucrative trades. We exaggerate the asymmetry of the cheap options because we assume we'd realize the full downside. But in reality, if we're short a front-end bond which sells off to 95, we're likely to just cover it. So the real downside is just 5 pts. Once we have that trade on, we tend to ignore the rest of the capital structure. But when the front-end bond drops 5 pts the rest of the curve will drop much more. Obviously the further out bonds have risk on the other side, but you have to do enough work to get comfortable with the asymmetry.
