**Trade and Savings Rate**
Pettis argues that the US runs a trade deficit because its reserve status forces it to have a capital account surplus. The trade deficit also implies a savings deficit (savings < investment), which is counterintuitive as the US is a developed economy. Many economists argue that the US has a savings deficit and thus has to import foreign savings. Pettis argues that the causality moves in the opposite direction.

Countries can boost their competitiveness by either increasing in investment or repressing local wages and domestic demand thus forcing a higher savings rate. If the excess savings are put into developing countries where capital is scarce, the overall effect can be positive. If instead they go to the US or similar countries where capital isn't scarce, they just repress demand in those countries. 

US income inequality should lead to a higher savings rate, as the rich consume less. The trade deficit however proves that any excess savings held by the rich are offset by a larger savings deficit elsewhere. If savings are not reinvested, over time, savings will not increase. The capital flows into the US can depress the savings rate by:
1) driving up the dollar relative to the price of tradeable goods will increase consumption. 
2) driving up unemployment due to the cheap foreign imports. The unemployed will have a negative savings rate.
3) higher unemployment also drives up government deficits, as fiscal transfers are needed. This further boosts consumption.
4) pushing the Fed to engage in loose monetary policy
5) boosting real estate and other asset bubbles. This wealth effect encourages even more consumption. 
6) Some of these bubbles will later be written down which is a reduction in total savings. 
7) pushing banks to lend more, especially to those who shouldn't be able to borrow. These loans fund further consumption. 

All of these can be summarized into a tradeoff. The higher dollar and trade deficit casuses unemployment. Either the US lives with the unemployment or it borrows and increases debt. Trade deficits and income inequality drive down domestic demand. This is made up by increasing debt. Economists may miss the relationship between trade deficits/income inequality and unemploment. That's because the rising debt ensures unemployment stays low. 

Higher savings in general should produce higher investment, but this depends on the type of investment. If there are ample projects which are not sensitive to demand (e.g. infrastructure in developing countries which must simply build more), higher savings (and lower consumption) should boost overall investment. These projects rely on capital at affordable rates, not demand. In rich countries however, most investment is highly sensitive to demand and not the cost of capital. Hence, higher savings (and less consumption) may actually cause less investment. Supply-side reforms like Trump's tax cuts then may lead to less investment overall. Most economists tend to argue that higher savings will always boost investment because there is some marginal project that isn't being funded. That's likely not the case in the developed world where capital has been close to free. 

**Egypt**
Egypt's trade deficit is driven by low exports (10% of GDP vs 37% for GS' EM sample) not high imports. [[Current Account Deficits]] gives a good framework for thinking about boosting exports. For Egypt, the main levers are to devalue the currency and for the state/military to decrease its involvement in the economy. The latter includes privatization of key assets and making the environemnt better for FDI. Important assets include the United Bank (in talks to be sold to Saudis) and Telecom Egypt (in talks to sell a 10% stake). Egypt's main imports (food, energy, etc) are inelastic and hence not adjusting with a weaker exchange rate. Exports haven't been boosted either, partially since many rely on key imports (especially raw materials).. High government spending (including defense and infrastructure) has added pressure to the current account. That's because fiscal spending crowds out private investment and hurts exports. It raises local interest rates and discourages FDI. 

The current account can also be thought of as the difference between savings and investment. Excess savings (S>I) will create a current account surplus and capital account deficit (purchases foreign assets). Chronic periods of savings below investment require the ability to export capital (sell treasuries to foreign investors). A "sudden stop" would require Egypt to either cut the current account (external adjustment - by depreciating the exchange rate) or repress domestic demand (internal adjustment - lowering economic growth and public spending)
