SFRFP was a buy last week. Jason's argument was correct, and my fundamental view was as well. Bonds were at recovery value and they have no incentive to accept concessions. Drahi had the most to lose from a default, and he was bluffing. They're still a little interesting, but 5 pts later, it's harder. The key question on Thurs was would seniors accept concessions. The answer was no - they had no need to. The business is declining, sure, but that was true before. If I had stuck to my framework, I would have concluded that that question was already answered. It was a declining business before. 
Declining EBITDA and its melting ice cube status was already in the price. The market concluded what price that scenario deserved. All that changed, was the increased probability of a distressed exchange. That's what I had to assess. The only change was the threat of a distressed exchange. There is risk that holdouts could be stripped of covenants, so it wasn't a riskless trade, but a lot of that was in the price already. 

They were also an "obvious" short before this recent move. I had been surprised with how quickly the bonds moved up given asset sale proceeds. I wish I had run some quick numbers and looked at the maturity schedule. It would have been a tough short given the market and "levers", but I wish I raised it.
