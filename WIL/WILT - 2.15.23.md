WILT
RAD earns a much higher margin on generic drugs than branded (7x), but the price is much lower (1/5). The gross profit earned per drug is hence pretty close for the two. Although the bonds look covered by the scripts and PBM, it's not clear who would buy the PBM. It's about scale, so they'll have a tough time competing with the big 3 (which make up 80% of prescriptions)

**Predictions**
RAD will have negative mid-single digit SSS in its front-end (i.e. non-drug sales)
RAD will be able to muddle through and keep servicing its debt. McKesson won't tighten terms as they have no need to and are getting paid.
