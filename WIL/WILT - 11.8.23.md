Sunnova's 11.75% bonds are NCL and so are a risky short if there's M&A risk. I'm assessing at what price there could be a buyer for Sunnova equity. At a certain price, there should be buyers for a stable portfolio of loans and leases. 

HA should be in the market for a EETC deal in the coming months. I'm coming up with a structure would like and will pitch that to their bankers (Citi and GS). We may be able to do something similar for Dish (double dip via an intercompany loan), and maybe others (Altice, AMC, CYH).
