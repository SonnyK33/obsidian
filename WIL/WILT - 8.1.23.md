Samarco
Samarco is coming out of a protracted bankruptcy process that started with a dam collapse in 2015. This would be the third post-Brazilian bankruptcy credits we're playing (after Odebrecht and Azul). This one isn't as compelling as there's revenue risk (price of iron ore), and high capex needs in 3 years means they may need to issue more debt. On my hierarchy of risks, price risk is the worst. The implied yield is 15%, which is cheap to comps by 200-300 bps. It used to trade 100 wide of Vale, but it's a completely different credit now. Unlike Odebrecht and Azul, this is a much worse credit than it was before the restructuring.

Niger coup
A coup in Nigeria is threatening the uranium supply for France. I've seen reports indicating almost all of France's uranium comes from its former colony. The ban on exports would follow similar actions by Burkina Faso last fall. It's an open question whether any foreign governments are behind the actions in Niger. The general who took over was close to the US, but there were reports that coup supporters were thanking Russia. A lot of anti-French/colonial sentiments are frequently conflated with pro-Russia sentiments. It's very reminiscent of the cold war and anti-colonial actions.
