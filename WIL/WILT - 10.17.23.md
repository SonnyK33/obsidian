The Israel/Hamas war will disrupt regional gas supplies. The Tamar field will be shut down, and gas will get diverted from Egypt (Leviathan) to Israel. This will have mixed effects on Leviathan's credit (better offtaker, but lower EBITDA), but will be negative for Egypt. LNG exports are a major source of FX for Egypt, and they stand to lose it. The Leviathan asset could also be at risk in a conflict, given it's only 10km from the border.

RAD finally filed for bankruptcy. I haven't gone through a process in detail before, so this will be a good learning opportunity. We were hoping for a liquidation, but chapter 11/restructuring is the plan for now. In hindsight, this was obvious; management will always prefer this route, and 1st lien lenders will get par regardless. Chapter 11 gives debtors a DIP and allows certain lenders (1st lien) to get paid back immediately.

We probably won't get the unsecureds which I think are a good bond. In the bull case (80%), bonds are worth 75. If they're zero in the bear case (30%), expected value is 60. I thought we should bid 50. Rachel muddied the waters by comparing them to the 2L's. While I think risk/reverse looks good in the 2L's, they aren't for sale, and so was irrelevant to the discussion. 

EV and Cars
From Ambrose Evans-Pritchard writing for the Telegraph
The worldâ€™s EV battery revolution, through the eyes of Goldman Sachs

There are now two zones for battery manufacturing - the US/South Korea, which specializes in ternary technology which uses cobalt and is more energy dense. This is useful for the larger cars in the US and the longer driving distances. Prices are being subsidized by the IRA, and South Korea will have 70% of the US market by 2025. China-Europe is the other zone which specializes in cheaper Lithium iron phosphate. These batteries last longer, do better in the heat, and don't require cobalt from Africa. Europe can't compete with China and will soon become completely dependent on cheaper EV's from China. Technology has developed rapidly and EV's will soon be at parity with ICE cars. 

Europe has become a marginal player in battery technology. This marks a major change, given Europe's history as a car manufacturer. It's trying in vain to catch up to China. Britain can't sell cars to Europe's EV market, given Brexit, without being subject to tariffs. It's only choice is to use subsidies to enable more "gigafactories". If following comparative advantage, it would buy batteries directly from China.  I agree with the author that industrial policy should be reserved for high-tech production, not copying China.

GCALC Deal
This is a complex structure and is deeply subordinated to other claims (PIK coupons and holdco box). Asset coverage seems adequate though. If we can get comfort that we could seize the equity in a default, these bonds should be okay.
