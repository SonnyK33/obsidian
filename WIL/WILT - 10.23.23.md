WILT
Argentina
Millei offended a lot of constituencies - the Pope, Biden, China, Brazil etc. Catholics may have voted against Millei. Other right-leaning groups may have worried if he can work properly with the rest of the world, especially China. 

Rite Aid
The buyer for the PBM is having financing issues. I hadn't mentioned this risk, but it highlights how there's always a market/beta component to even highly idiosyncratic trades. 

Citgo
These bonds are a much easier trade than PDVSA. Could be 8-10 pts from a sale, which would come well before any PDVSA/VENZ recovery.
