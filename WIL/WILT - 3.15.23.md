This new Fed facility allows banks to borrow par against discount bonds. This net increases the money-ness of these instruments and the amount of liquidity in the system. It reminded me of the Kindleberger argument on liquidity I read in Petit's book/

The latest Hersh piece mentioned a story I had never heard of. The US desire to prervent the Soviet Union from exporting hydrocarbons to Europe goes back to the 1960s. Kennedy tried to stop a pipleline from Siberia from being built. Reagan asked West Germany and France to abandon plans to lend for the pipeline. They refused. Reagan responded by secondary sanctions on those companies. The US' bombing of the Nord Stream stems from this same desire to block Russia from using its natural resources for it's own purposes. Biden, when speaking to the Atlantic Council, claimed he wasn't against Russia exporting its oil but that it had to play by the rules. He said Russia couldn't "weaponize" energy or use it for foreign policy. I'm not sure what country would follow that rule. Would the US continue exporting LNG to countries opposed to its foreign policy. Obviously not. 

A piece I read today pointed out how Taiwan's entire electricity infrastructure is centralized to a few plants and is vulnerbale to cyber attacks. The author argued that the US could conduct a false flag there in the summer when the elderly population would be hurt by the high temperatures. That would be used to turn the local population against China to set the stage for a referendum for independence. That could force China's hand and allow for the US to intervene under the pretext of supporting Taiwan. The US wouldn't institute a draft to fight China but would rely on proxy states (especially Japan and others in SE Asia). It would also need Europe and Australia to support trade sanctions on China. I think it would be hard to get local populations on board, global South countries (India, Brazil, etc.) would be dead set against it. A large portion of the German population is against sending weapons to Ukraine and would surely be against war with China. Theory around trade in a multipolar system also says that the US and its partners will trade with China until the end due to competition amongst themselves. The US also needs China for key goods in its supply chain, including weapons. 

The big story today is CS is imploding. Interestingly, the Swiss National Bank hasn't capitualted yet. Unlike the US with SVB. This echoes an earlier point from El Arian when he compared the UK's response to the SVB sub to that of the US. Outside the US, authorities aren't willing to risk moral hazard to maintain financial stability. 

I lost money today day trading Nasdaq futures. I've done this too many times. My mistakes can be divided into:
1) Getting in to the trade too late and thinking about why it was trading where it way. Stupid as it sounds, Nasdaq was rallying because financial contagion would mean lower rates. That argument is stupid because lower rates are occurring because of a disaster. Nevertheless, if you were going to fold after losing $3k, then you shouldn't have put it on. While the price seems to make no sense, why was it going to change so quickly? You should've anticipated the scenario where it gets more irrational before it doesn't. You need to think about stop losses and at what point you'd admit you're wrong. If you had waited longer, there were better levels to cover. But ex-ante, it made sense to cover because it was clear you had no view, and it rallied further. But you wasted $3k because you didn't think through where your pain point is. What you did was pure gambling. Just do the easy trades. 
2) Getting the trade right and then capitulating when it retraces. This is partially the same issue. Is this a long-term trade or following a trend. If it's the latter, take some profits as trend weakens or reverses. If it's long-term, stops should be wide. 

The loss you'd take if the stop was hit should be the carry. That's the carry you're willing to pay for asymmetric gains. For now on, write each of these trades down with upside/downside.

If you don't have the conviction, just sit in treasuries.
