Had a call with a Euro REITs analyst today. Learned that leases tend to be long-term in Germany, and CPI escalators have kept rent increasing. The Nordics tend to have more floating rate debt and have more leverage, making them the worst of the sector. Many German REITS are suffering from declining office demand and cyclical risk. However, the credits look okay. The main headwind seems to growing interest expense from their floating rate hybrids, which makes recapitalization the key catalyst. If they can issue unsecureds to take out hybrids at above current prices, but still well below par, they can create equity value and cut coupons. Why does this trade exist? The Euro market may be reopening more slowly than the US. Conservative management teams have also hinted coupon deferrals in the past which spooked investors. Macroeconomic weakness remains, which is weighing on multiples and equity valuations. This has decreased the probability of equity injections or raises. It seems to be an interesting sector with a solid catalyst. If we can reverse into some new financings, we could get colour on management's plans, and the possibilities for a better capital structure. 

I'm working on the ideas pipeline and my reverse strategy. I think both will be very useful in terms of my productivity and enhancing my visibility outside the firm. The goal is to send out monthly thoughts on sectors and levels to show how we're thinking about new financings. That colour will help us position for new deals. I see three pillars to my job now:
1) Idea management (pipeline)
2) Financings and colour on management's plans (reverses and dialogue with lev fin)
3) Compiling key questions for credits and sectors, making predictions, and updating those with new information 

I will focus on the HY and EM sov sectors for now. Large EM corps could be interesting as well, but I don't see a lot of big structures to spend time on right now.
