I read a piece by MMT economist Fullwiler which ties together some BoP arguments with MMT thinking. It was written in the context planned fiscal austerity in 2011. Binder wrote about this period [[A Monetary and Fiscal History of the US 1961-2021]] and argued that Obama's hands were tied, as congress was taken over by Republicans in the mid-term elections. 

Using the familiar equation - 
M - X = (I - S) -Â (T - G)
They arrange it as:

Current Account Balance = Domestic Private Savings + Budget Surplus
Private Savings = CA Balance + Budget Deficit

His point is that if the deficit is decreased, assuming the the current account balance doesn't improve (which would coincide with a smaller capital account surplus), private savings must decrease. As has been argued by [[Trade Wars are Class Wars]] and [[Bernanke on Savings Glut]], the trade deficit is at least partially driven by the world's excess savings coming into the US. A lower deficit may also increase foreigners' confidence in the US economy and lead to more inflows. That's what you would expect for most EM's. 

A decrease in private savings is the same as leveraging. Negative savings are also associated with economic fragility and asset bubbles. [[Bernanke on Savings Glut]] discusses this. Fullwiller argues that a decrease in private savings may actually not occur. Households will react to fiscal austerity by reducing their savings as well, hence leading to lower overall output (GDP) and lower tax receipts. Thus the fiscal balance is "endogenous" to the public's reaction. It's circular. The less the government spends, the less the public spends -- a reinforcing loop in [[Thinking in Systems]] jargon.
