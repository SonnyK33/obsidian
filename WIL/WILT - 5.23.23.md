For homebuilders, the cancellation rate doesn't have a major impact on P&L, as builders agressively sell the houses with promotions. During a softening market, order rates drop, causing inventory to run down. This initially leads to a release in FCF. But since the backlog isn't building with new orders, it will lead to lower EBITDA in 2-3 quarters. There's also the question of what management will do with the excess generated. Will they buy back stock, expand into new territories, or conserve cash?

Pettis argues that it is possible to be the reserve currency without running trade deficits. To be the central currency, you have to accomodate the worlds' needs. Earlier in the 20th century, Europe and Asia needed to rebuild post-WW2. This meant they had to import US savings, which led to a US trade surplus. That's shifted now; the rest of the world has excess savings and limited demand and so has exported that to the US causing a trade deficit. I'm not sure if being a global currency is synonymous with being a reserve currency?
