Big story is obviously SVB and the fate of regional banks. Unsecured bonds at SVB and other regionals are curiously pricing in a recovery. Bank bail-in rules are supposed to ensure no recovery for bondholders and shareholders if a bank fails. If FRC is sold for a reasonable price, it is conceivable that there's recovery. 

The Fed's bailout of uinsured deposits allow banks to borrow par against their treasuries and Agency MBS. That is, despite the mark-to-market losses these notes have taken, their collateral value will be par for this fed facility. So it's wrong to say this won't cost the taxpayers anything. It effectively means money printing to bail out uninsured depositors.
