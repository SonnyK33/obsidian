December and January are the busiest tourism months for Egypt. There's an election in December, and now there's the real risk of a refugee crisis there. There's reports that Israel is telling Gazans to flee to Egypt. Front-end bonds are still in the low 90's; this looks like an easy short here.

We've been trying to find derivatives of Argentina to short, given our long position. Uruguay and Paraguay look like good candidates given their trade relationship and tight levels.
