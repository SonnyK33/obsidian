El Salvador deal is interesting. The detachable warrant will pay 0.25% if there is a deal and 4% if there isn't. In the first case (which is a bullish scenario), the PV would be <1 pt. In the latter case, it could be >7 pts using a 20% discount rate. In a default, your claim is ~13 pts because they use the higher payout (4%) discounted at the vanilla bond's coupon (9%). If you assume a 30% sovereign recovery, the warrant would be worth ~4pts. So it's worth more in a bankruptcy.
