Update on FDIC actions - SBNY and FRC

I learned a lot about the FDI resolution process. When a bank goes under and is taken over by the FDIC, it creates a bridge bank that holds assets. This new bank then sells assets and uses the proceeds to recover on its subrogration claim. The FDIC will attempt to find buyers for both the failed bank's deposits and loans. An acquiror can pay a discount on the loans and may pay a premium or a discount for the deposits. Loans purchased in this arrangement typically get a loss share agreement under which the FDIC will reimburse and get paid back 80% of losses and gains, respectively. This means that an acquiror may get loans at a discount and get further proceeds from the FDIC if the loans recover less than par. 

SBNY looks the most interesting for two reasons. First, the FDIC is retaining a lot of the loans, and so the small tranches of subs, prefs, and common stock holders stand to benefit. Second, the loan portfolio continues to earn income, which flows to the estate. The order of priority is FDIC claims, senior claims, sub claims, FDIC accrued claims, senior accrued claims, sub accrued claims, prefs, and common. So this means that the sub bonds get paid back par before the FDIC benefits from this income. It's also a big differentiator between the subs and the prefs. In this way, the subs benefit if the FDIC takes its time. The common and prefs benefit if they can sell assets for a reasonable price.

The FRC securities don't benefit from residual assets and would require JPM to realize losses and then high recoveries on FRC assets. SIBV is still to determined but looks more like a litigation claim. 


Boeing/SPR
Nothing to do on Boeing, as the 787-9 is a small program for them. Spirit could be in trouble though.

Portfolio Construction
I'm paying a lot more attention to factors in the research portfolio. Using some of the techniques in that quant approach to fundamental portfolio, I'm also going to breakdown my skill into its constituent parts. Idiosyncratic return can be broken into selection, timing, and sizing. I suspect I'm good at the first and last. 

Capex
Most investors expect telco capex to decline this year and for cable capex to increase. That's inline with my expectations as well. That may be good for Commscope at the margin.
