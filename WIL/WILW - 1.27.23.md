Construction
A good thread on the lack of lay-offs in the construction sector (https://twitter.com/SteveMiran/status/1617239573687578624). The key takeaway is that the government's infrastructure spending may be making this corner of the labour market even tighter. Builders may be reluctant to fire workers given the increased spending. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will bring ~$40bn in federal spending for construction/infrastructure in 2023 and $54 billion next year. 

**EM Continued**
China is taking a much more active role in EM debt restructurings. In Zambia, it's pushing for local currency debt to be included in the restructuring and for official creditors (IMF/World Bank) to take losses as well. China is now the largest lender to developing countries, and so its likely to take an increasingly prominent role. Yellen critiized China for delaying the Zambia restructuring. The US has repeatedly crticized China for delaying restructurings and supposedly unfair lending terms. Contrary to the Western potrayal, China's demands seem more fair and better for the debtor. This also highlights the IMF/World Bank's (and the US) declining importance to the developing world. 


Argentine buybacks may be a tactic by the government to boost the exchange rate ahead of the election. 

The Vaca Muerta will be a game changer in Argentina. The Nestor Kirchner pipeline will be completed by June and will generate import savings of $2.5bn. This will increase as other projects are completed and they are able to increase oil and natural gas exports. 
Dollar amortizations are low this year and next ($2bn and 5bn respectively). They increase to 10bn in 2025, but assuming there's a new government in power, and fiscal deficits are cut, this should be manageable. CDS is pricing in a 90% chance of defaulting within 3 years and assumes policy continuity. Current yields will be stepping up. The 2016 indenture front-end bonds may have the most upside. The 30s also amortize and so you're getting 9.5 points in P+I in 1.5 years. 

Key question is whether this government will lose the election and the extent of any fiscal adjustment. How much of an adjustment is possible?

They have ways to manage their reserve position. They can cut dollar allocations to imports (which?), issue dollar futures, others? They can continue printing money to avoid a local default. 

If Argentina's tax to GDP rate was comparable to Brazil (is currently 19 vs 36%), that would close the fiscal gap. Persisent high fiscal deficits crowd out private investment and keep local yields high. This makes foreign investment difficult and limits the ability to generate adequate hard currency for its debtload. The lack of foreign investment devalues the currency. A weak currency makes imports expensive. Rather than allowing that pain to hit the people, it allows importers to buy USD at artifical rates, using up the country's reserves.


**Bank Reserves and RRP**

The Fed is now treating RRP and bank reserves as fungible for liquidity purposes. That is, it's willing to continue QT even if bank reserves run low. The logic is that banks can simply raise deposit rates to pull funds from the RRP (depositors would withdraw from MMFs and move them to deposits). Along with this, they announced they're willing to continue QT even if they have to cut rates. The main implication of this change is higher deposit rates and lower NIMs for banks. This will hurt bank earnings and lower future lending (which is the point).


Some officials have called for the Fed to change the spread between the RRP and resereve back to 25 bps from the current 10. This will cause QT to pull money from the RRP rather than reserves.

This plus a Fed governor's announcement that bank reserves and RRP should both be treated as liquidity means deposit rates will have to increase. Unless corporate profitability starts to go up, lending will be less profitable as NIMs shrink. 


**Fed and Rate Cuts?**

The Fed uses core PCE ex-housing rents, not CPI as its inflation guage. Core PCE hasn't been decreasing the way CPI has. The sharp slow down in CPI is driven by a methodological difference in medical care insurance. Core PCE has barely dcreased. It rose 0.3% in Dec, the same as the prior period. This is 4% annually versus 2% pre-covid. 

Bloomberg is modeling 3% inflation in late-'23 - early '24. The last 100 bps of disinflation will be tough as will be operating in the flat part of the Philips curve. Bloomberg estimates it would take 3pp increase in unemployment to get there. 

The rates market is still forecasting a 50 bps cut by year-end. That only happens in a depression or miracle. 

CPI uses a strange methodology for health care insurance. It looks at the earnings of insurance companies as a proxy. Data is also lagged by almost a year. During 2020 utilization of medical services was low and so profits were high. This was taken to mean higher premnium inflation. Data is also lagged by 10 months, so the decline in utilization in early 2020 showed up by early 2021. 


Option implied probabilities on eurodollar future Dec '24 options imply 10% odds of rates below 1.5 (i.e. a recession) and a 14% probabilitiy of rates between 4-6 (higher for longer). The odds are 1% and 39% for recession and higher for longer for the Dec '23 contract. So eurodollar market is expecing higher for longer through this year, with odds for a recession rising next year, but still low. Macrocompass' view is that this shows the market is not expecting a recession but disinfinlation to 2% which allows the Fed to cut to neutral rates (which are positive in real terms). 

**Wrong price given fundamentals or wrong fundamentals?**

For all trades, need to articulate why it trades where it does. How did that factor perpetuate over time pushing the valuation away where it should be. For Argentina, it's due to the low coupons on the bonds and getting everyone flushed out.  Everyone is focused on the debtload and not looking at where the current account can go. 

From macro ops,
1) analytical edge - look for the underlying factors and see if can come to an out of consensus conclusion 
2) look over overreactions in either direction - similar to my "assets at extremes"
3) "arbitrage time" by taking a medium/long-term view
	1) requires macro thinking
