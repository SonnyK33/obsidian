**A New Paradigm for EM Restructuring**

China is taking a much more active role in EM debt restructurings. In Zambia, it's pushing to include local currency debt in the restructuring and for official creditors (IMF/World Bank) to take losses. China is now the largest lender to developing countries. We should expect it to take an increasingly prominent role. Secretary Yellen has criticized China for delaying the Zambia restructuring. China's demands actually seem more fair and better for the debtor. This highlights the IMF's (and the US') declining importance to the developing world.

  
What I like in EM

Argentina is one of the few EM stories I'm bullish on. Its ample shale reserves (Vaca Muerta) will be a game changer. Argentina will complete the Nestor Kirchner pipeline by June. This will generate import savings of $2.5bn. Although Argentina gets a lot of attention for its large IMF program, debt service is low this year and next. It increases to 10bn in 2025. Assuming there's a new government by then, this should be manageable. CDS is pricing in a 90% chance of defaulting within 3 years and it assumes policy continuity. The pipeline is enough of a reason to like Argentina. Sovereign bonds are very cheap, and they have some interesting features. Current coupons will be stepping up. The 2030s also amortize and so you're getting 9.5 points in P+I in 1.5 years.

  

As Argentina seems to restructure its debt every two years, it's worth asking why. I plan on doing a deeper dive into this question, but one thing that immediately stood out to me was taxes. If Argentina's tax to GDP rate was comparable to Brazil (it's currently 19 vs 36%), that would close the fiscal gap. High fiscal deficits crowd out private investment and keep local yields high. It makes foreign investment difficult and limits the ability to generate hard currency. The lack of foreign investment devalues the currency. A weak currency should make imports expensive. The government doesn't want that inflation to hit people. Hence they allow importers to buy USD at artificial rates which. This burns valuable reserves.

  

  

**Bank Reserves and RRP**

The Fed is now treating RRP and bank reserves as fungible for liquidity purposes. That is, it's willing to continue QT even if bank reserves run low. The logic is that banks can raise deposit rates to pull funds from the RRP. They also said that they're willing to continue QT even if they have to cut rates. The main implication of this change is higher deposit rates and lower NIMs for banks. This will hurt bank earnings and lower future lending (which is the point). Some have called for the Fed to change the spread between the RRP and IOR to 25 bps from the current 10. This will cause QT to pull money from the RRP rather than reserves.

  

**Fed's Inflation Measure and Rate Cuts**

The Fed uses core PCE ex-housing rents, not CPI as its inflation gauge. Core PCE hasn't been decreasing the way CPI has. Medical insurance has been a driver of the slow down in CPI. There's a methodological difference in how medical insurance factors in CPI vs PCE. CPI uses the earnings of insurance companies as a proxy for medical insurance costs. During 2020, utilization of medical services was low and so profits were high. This was taken to mean higher premium inflation. Data is also lagged by 10 months, so the decline in utilization in early 2020 showed up by early 2021.

  

Core PCE has barely decreased. It rose 0.3% in Dec, the same as the prior period. Bloomberg is modeling 3% inflation in late-'23 - early '24. The last 100 bps of disinflation will be tough. Bloomberg estimates it would take 3pp increase in unemployment to get there. The rates market is still forecasting a 50 bps cut by year-end. That only happens in a depression or miracle.

  

**Construction and Layoffs**

The construction sector is one of the biggest employers in the US. The market watches layoffs in the industry closely as they have an outsized impact . I found a good thread on the lack of lay-offs in the construction sector. (https://twitter.com/SteveMiran/status/1617239573687578624). The takeaway is that the government's infrastructure spending may be making the labour market tighter. Builders may be reluctant to fire workers given the increased spending. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will bring ~$40bn in federal spending for in 2023 and $54 billion next year. This is one of many examples of how high fiscal deficits are making the Fed's job harder.

  

**Trade Analysis: Wrong price given fundamentals or wrong fundamentals?**

For all trades, you need to articulate why it trades where it does. How did that factor perpetuate over time pushing the valuation away where it should be. For Argentina, it's due to the low coupons on the bonds and everyone getting flushed out. Everyone is focusing on the debt and not looking at where the current account can go. So this is a case of "wrong fundamentals".
