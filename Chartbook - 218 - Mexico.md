Tooze argues that Mexico, while supposedly part of the US' sphere of influence, is increasingly moving closer to China. In the past, Mexico saw China as a competitor. As the US has ramped up the war on drugs, and come close to threatening war over fentanyl, Mexico is increasingly looking to China. China has also made efforts to get closer with Mexico rather than to compete with it. 

With the push to "friend-shoring", the market is looking at NAFTA as the biggest beneficiary of the cold  war with China. But while Canada is fully on board with the US, Mexico has been drifting further away with AMLO. On the US side, a growing share of Republicans are calling for the US to bomb the cartels (i.e. bomb Mexico). 

Since the Mexican revolution, it has sought independence from the US. This is rooted in the racism of the North towards the Hispanic (and Catholic) South. That nationalist ideology went down during the twentieth century but reemerged with AMLO. The war on drugs (and the flow of guns from the US) has made the relationship worse, along with migration crisis. China as the origin of fentanyl makes the whole relationship worse. 

Since the Russia/Ukraine war, Mexico has been careful to stay neutral and has condemned the US for providing military aid to Ukraine. Americans are wary of Russian involvement in Mexico and the commander of the Northern Command has claimed that Russia has deployed the largest share of its spies to Mexico. 

Up until recently, Mexico has not been a part of China's push into Latin America. From 2002-19, Chinese trade with Latin America has went from 17 to 300+ billion. Mexico was not a part of this, and was angry when China was admitted to the WTO. Mexico now sees China as a partner, but the US as made clear that if it entered into a trade agreement with it, Mexico would be pushed out of NAFTA. It would be sanctioned if it entered the BRI program. However, China has become a key partner in some areas; it's the second largest trading partner (after the US) in Nuevo Leon (capital is Monterrey).

Chinese criminals have increasingly used the fentanyl trade to evade exchange controls China put in place in 2015. China was cooperating on this front, but that ended with Pelosi's visit to Taiwan. Guns from the US have also empowered the cartels. AMLO views the DEA agents operating in Mexico as an affront to its sovereignty. Trump seriously considered sending the military into Mexico, and many republicans would support that (Tom Cotton, Crenshaw, etc). There is deep-seeded resentment towards Mexico (rooted in racism) from many right-wing Republicans who would have no problem invading it in the name of stopping a narco-state. The US sees its interests as trumping all others, and may be forced to act at some point.
