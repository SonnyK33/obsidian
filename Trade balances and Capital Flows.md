Start from first principles and a 2 state model. Both countries are initially trading goods and both maintain a trade balance. That is, they’re exchanging goods thought to be equal in value. If one country then wants to spend money on infrastructure, they could make a deal with the other country in which they still receive the imports but don’t have to export for a few years after which they’ll repay with extra exports. The second country is now financing the gap.

Thus a trade deficit is equivalent to borrowing the balance and a surplus is lending the balance. That’s why a trade deficit is a capital inflow.

A trade surplus means domestic investors are putting funds abroad, and a deficit means foreign investment is being received. The flows of capital aren’t just government debt. They also include all of the ways private investors in one country can invest in another - purchasing real estate or financial assets - stocks, bonds etc.
