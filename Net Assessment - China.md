Political Constraints - 

When analyzing a leaderâ€™s power, you must consider various factors.
1) How popular is he
2) how long has he been in power (most start with a honeymoon period)
3) how much control over legislature does he have
4) what's the economic context (did he create or inherit a crisis? Macri vs Bolsonaro for example)
5) how much support does he have from special interest groups
6) global context (e.g. Arab Spring, pink tide in Latin America)

What are Key Data Streams?


For discrete events, build decision trees and assign conditional probabilities. Thinking in specific probabilities often leads to better predictions. For medium and long term assessments, the goal is to determine prior biases, not probabilities as in the discrete events. 
Biases (eg bearish) and probabilities are then updated with new info (for non-discrete, info should be for binding constraints).
