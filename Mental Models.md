**The Map is not the Territory**
Maps (models, abstractions, etc) are useful representations of the truth. However, you shouldn't confuse them with reality. Understand their shortcomings and don't become too reliant. Recognize when they won't work, and why they appear to do so. In most cases, models simplify one or two aspects of a situation. Don't forget about the others. This reminded me of Plato's Cave Allegory. We often only see the shadows and not the real thing. But this is about situations where you make the shadow yourself, and forget that it's the shadow and not the real thing.
