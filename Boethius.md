He grew up in privilege, similar to the Buddha. He argued that God knows what will happen but that doesn’t mean we don’t have free will. There's a difference between knowing what will happen and forcing it to happen. God's knowledge of your future doesn’t take away your ability to change it. This is hard to reconcile with. If it's known, how do we have free will? It implies God knows how we will chose.

Good fortune can be misleading because it’s fleeting. As Plato said, it’s fine if a kid is afraid of the dark, but adults shouldn’t be afraid of light. That is, it's fine to be scared of the unknown. But those who know, shouldn't be afraid of being revealed. You shouldn’t be afraid to see things as they really are.
