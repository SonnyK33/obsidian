In EM, you can get paid a lot to give up liquidity (Eg Pemex suppliers vs Pemex bonds). There may be value here, as even "liquid" instruments become illiquid in a crisis. 

There's less correlation among EMs now, due to a smarter market, and a lack of shocks (I don't agree with this). Markets react to catalysts differently e.g. oil shocks.
