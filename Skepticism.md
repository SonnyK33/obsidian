You can’t trust cognitive observances and can never be certain of anything. One should suspend judgement on everything. He may have gotten ideas from the naked philosophers of India and skeptics in pre-Socratic Greece (i.e. parminitea)  

Nothing exists in reality and habits and convention are all that matter. This seems connected with existentialism. But then how can you believe in skepticism either?  

How can we know what’s really good for us? You may get what you need but still be unhappy. Don’t assume you know what you want. Be skeptical of everything and play devils advocate. Be humble and question everything. Try to question both sides of an argument. The practical application is to live based on what’s likely but remain skeptical. You may not  need verification for everything ( tiger attacking you example), but accept that you can't know the truth.
