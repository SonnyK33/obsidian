I need to read more about the CFA Franc. It provides a good demonstration of the pros and cons of a monetary union. The Euro is the obvious analogue, with peripheral countries playing the part of West African countries. The regime has created winners and losers in the former colonial states - that's also the case in peripheral Europe. Who are the winners? It's a smaller example of the power of currency hegemony - a microcosm of what the US can do around the world.
