The RAD equity trade was very different from COIN or CYH. It lacked the fundamental catalyst of CYH and technical of coin (end of tax season). It isn’t a go-to risk-on stock like COIN, and lacked its narrative. It has bankruptcy risk that coin doesn’t have.  

If it’s a call option, what’s the value of that call vs its own history and the rest of capital structure?

You bought the underlying and not calls because you thought it was just fundamentally cheap and didn’t have a view on timing. But the stock is decaying in value given bond maturities and anemic FCF. How much is that call actually worth? Would you spend $30k on call premium? 

Think about - 

1) why does it trade where it is
2) what’s the catalyst to change (fundamental or technical)

2a) just cheap may be a catalyst but it’s not a great one. It’ll require people to notice it like they did with energy. What’s the broader narrative that this stock could fall under? Oxy benefited from a much larger energy narrative. What’s RAD’s narrative ? Just cheap means it’s a call option which could decay to zero. Size appropriately it.

3) what’s the narrative and what activates it

4) if it’s just a cheap stock and can be viewed as a call, what’s that call worth? This isn’t just academic - others are doing this same math. 

4a) spend 1-5k max for a dumb call option. Remember Downside is 100pct
