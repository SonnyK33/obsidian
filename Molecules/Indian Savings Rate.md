Mody in this FT article, makes the same argument as in [[Geopolitical Alpha]] that India is constrained by a lack of investment, which is due to a low savings rate. Mody's focus is on how an over-valued Rupee constrains the export sector. This has prevented an export manufacturing boom, like that experienced in East Asia in the 1990s, and Vietnam and Bangladesh more recently. Mody references the increasing cost of production in India, and the real effective exchange rate as a reference point for where the nominal exchange rate should go. The overly strong exchange rate has led to fewer low skilled jobs, which traditionally come from the manufacturing sector. Mody highlights 3 reasons behind India's anemic export sector - uneducated workforce, low female workforce participation, and overvalued exchange rate. He argues in his project-syndicate piece, that no country since the industrial revolution has been able to jump to developed status without massive investments in human capital and gender equality. Chinese female workforce participation fell from 80% in 1990 to 62% today; India's went from 32% to 25% in the same period. 

Pettis, in a twitter thread, contrasts India with China. He argues that India, unlike China, is actually savings-constrained. The way to increase savings is to decrease consumption, and devaluing the currency will cut consumption. A weaker currency transfers power from net importers (consumers) to manufacturers. The poorest Indians are not importers and so may not be hurt by a weaker currency and passed-through inflation. A weaker currency will hurt middle-class Indians and the wealthy to buy foreign goods. This is an interesting contrast with China or Japan. In those countries, the elites are in exporters and government owned entities. It's hard to allow the currency to appreciate in those countries because that shifts power away from them and to consumers. Because they haven't taken appropriate actions, they suffer from  weak domestic demand. The elites in India, on the other hand, are not primarily exporters or manufacturers. The wealthy enjoy being able to import luxury goods and travel abroad. I suspect, net-net they benefit from stronger domestic demand, as India is a consumption-led economy. That's why it's hard to let the Rupee depreciate. It's much more similar to a developed country in that regard. 

This is a good framework to think about constraints. Which group holds the power? Net importers or exporters?
