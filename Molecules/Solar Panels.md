- why do polysilicon manufacturers need to sell to chip makers to be competitive?


Solar panels, like oil, weapons manufacturing, and semiconductors, are becoming important industries that states are attempting to build rather than relying on foreign imports. Vertical integration is becoming important after decades of complex supply chains sitting across different countries. 

Lebanese people are switching to solar panels as state has collapsed. I heard same thing from a Jefferies analyst regarding South Africa. This likely worsens inequality as many canâ€™t afford panels, and it further delegitimizes the state and democracy. 

From Gavekal 12.21.22 - "India's Solar moonshot"
India is attempting to become a major solar power as part of its push into renewables. It is  targeting 500 gigawatt of installed capacity by 2030 to come from renewable sources (including hydro and nuclear). Currently 70% of energy comes from fossil fuels. It's currently reliant on China for solar panels and is trying to create a domestic industry. A lot of Chinese polysilicon is refined in Xinjiang, and so India is at risk of being blocked from importing it due to US sanctions. It's using subsidies and import tariffs to help the domestic industry. Adani and Reliance both won bids to build polysilicon plants, but there's also a lot of capacity from China coming online.
It's also challenging to build a polysilicon industry without a semiconductor industry. Polysilicon refiners need to sell to chip makers as well as solar manufacturers (why?). India doesn't have a chip industry though is also trying to build one. 

Like the defense industry (see: [[Indian Defense Spending]]), the state is relying on large conglomerates (Reliance and Adani for example) to develop the industry. Except for the UAE, India is the cheapest place for solar energy (cheaper than gas and coal). Also like the defense industry, the push to build a home grown industry could prevent India from reaching manufacturing goals. 

The import substitution tactics are starting to resemble India of the 1970s when industries complained about too much regulation ("license raj"). For example, Indian officials need to travel to China to approve all imports of solar cells from China.
