Papic argues that most political leaders are accountable to the median voter and will pay attention to the most important issues affecting  this group. The median voter thus acts as a contraint on the leader and guides his policies. Although this seems obvious, analysts are frequently guilty of ignoring the political constraints facing leaders. There are a few stories right now that can be viewed with this lense.

**Egypt**
Egyptian real wages are down 70% since the Egyptian revolution in 2011. Anecdotally, one analayst said they're the most unhappy they've been in a decade. The IMF did not give them a generous deal and knows that structural reforms, especially a weaker currency, are not tested. The government's most important objective is maintaining social stability. People may be reluctant to come to the streets at first due to the opressive government. However, it was unthinkable that Mubarak would get thrown out like he was in 2011. The backdrop is different this time (no Arab Spring), but the macro situation is much worse. Even the autocratic Sisi government must pay attention to the median voter. MVT says Egypt most likely won't stick to the IMF plan.

**Brazil**
Echoing the January 6 riots, far-right Bolsonaro supporters attacked government buildings in Brazil during Lula's inauguration. The Brazilian government promptly arrested hundreds of protestors. Unlike Biden in the US, Lula didn't shy from blaming the military for inadequate preparations. In the US, ~10% of the arrested rioters have some form of military background, but this fact is rarely discussed. In Brazil, the memory of the military dictatorship (which ended in 1985) is still fresh. Lula has to tread carefully though. Many military leaders remain loyal to Bolsonaro and a sizable minority believe Lula is a criminal who shouldn't have been able to run. Who is the median voter in Brazil? I would suspect he's most likely a Lula supporter. However, does MVT still work when the minority is better financed and armed than the majority?

**China**
The reopening and talks of stimulus have propelled the real estate sector. There's good reason to think though that the recovery will be muted. One of the sparks of the Hong Kong protests was high costs of living. Xi will hence be reluctant to allow mainland real estate to return to pre-pandemic highs.

**Peru**
Castillo was forced from power after attempting to dissolve congress. Some say he was entitled to do so legally given congress attempted to impeach him twice. His supporters have been protesting since he was arrested. The median voter is likely a Castillo supporter. Early elections or not, the country will likely be pulled in a more radical direction. Assuming the military or outside powers don't intervene, the next leader will likely be a leftist like Castillo. He'll try to pass radical reforms in response to what happened to Castillo. 

**Germany - All quiet on the western front**
The harsh piece forced on Germany after WW1 is widely blamed as a contributing factor to WW2. MVT applies even to your vanquished enemies. We are forgetting (or ignoring this) when thinking about Russia and how the average Russian views the Ukraine conflict. One of the reasons for this is we continue the lie that the average Russian is against Putin. Even if that's true, they're surely not pro-Western.

**Slaughter House 5**
In the scene where Campbell pitches the POWs to join Germany, the narrator talks about war attempts to destroy your individuality. It tries to eliminate the median voter and turn the entire public into one amorphous jingoistic blob
