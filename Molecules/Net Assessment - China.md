Political Constraints - 

When analyzing a leader’s power, you must consider various factors.
1) How popular is he
2) how long has he been in power (most start with a honeymoon period)
3) how much control over legislature does he have
4) what's the economic context (did he create or inherit a crisis? Macri vs Bolsonaro for example)
5) how much support does he have from special interest groups
6) global context (e.g. Arab Spring, pink tide in Latin America)

How does [[Median Voter Theory]] apply?

Economic Constraints
[[WILT - 8.29.23]]
- debt capacity
- few domestic investment opportunities left
- how to stimulate domestic demand
- will exports bounce back? In which sector have exports fell?
- what else?

Pettis' 5 Paths for China:

1) Continue accumulating debt 

Even though it’s domestic debt, it’s still unsustainable. That it’s domestic just means they’re running CA surpluses. The US in the 1920s and Japan in the 1970s -80s went through this with disastrous outcomes. Excessive debt fueled by demand without adequate supply will lead to various trade offs (find Pettis piece explaining this). Isn’t supply coming from the infrastructure. No, not if they're bad investments.
  

2) Replace poor investments with good ones, in new technologies for example. This could be difficult given the amount of capital that would have to be channeled into technology. Institutions have also been built around real estate investments. Those could be turned on their head if this shifted into tech. Pettis is least convincing here. What are the constraints exactly? How much was invested into EV cars? He said so far 10pct of GDP had gone into tech while 30 has gone into each of infrastructure and property. So there would be a huge shift. Doesn’t that imply a boom for domestic tech?  

3) Shift to consumption.

Has been discussed in other places but the constraints are around shifting income from local governments to households. There are likely institutional hurdles to that power shift.

4) Shift to exports

Would need to grow the surplus by 3pct of Chinese GDP which is likely impossible for a country of China's size. This won’t be accepted by the rest of the world.  

5) Do nothing 

This will lead to much slower growth - low single digits. Either a financial crisis or lost decades are likely. Pettis believes the second is most probable
 

Some combination of 2,3, 4, and 5 are most likely. I think the push will be 2 and there will be domestic winners. We could see these outcomes:
1) A big push for high tech manufacturing (EV cars, batteries, chips)
2) easing labour restrictions (the Hukuo system) which will allow for lower private savings
3) Allow a weaker currency. The rate differential is doing this anyways. The risk here is capital flight.
4) Accept lower growth, going forward.







Geopolitical Constraints
- mainly about geography

Time Constraints
- will be hard to go long in the short-term 

What are Key Data Streams?


For discrete events, build decision trees and assign conditional probabilities. Thinking in specific probabilities often leads to better predictions. For medium and long term assessments, the goal is to determine prior biases, not probabilities as in the discrete events. 
Biases (eg bearish) and probabilities are then updated with new info (for non-discrete, info should be for binding constraints).
