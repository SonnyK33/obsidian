**Organizational Chart**
Map out the capital structure, including all issuing and guaranteeing entities.
Guarantees are important. If the notes aren't guaranteed, they'll be structurally junior to any debt issued by subsidiaries in the future. 

**Bonds/Loans**
Identify all debt instruments, and for each, indicate the issuing entity, guarantors, and the restricted group. Identifiy the instrument's ranking (including its guarantee) and the collateral, if any.

**Debt Covenant** 

For each instrument, find the "Debt" covenant (often labelled "Limitation on Debt").
The first paragraph of the covenant will give you the ratio test and tell you how much debt it can incur while staying in compliance. There is typically a ratio test (people will refer to ratio debt) which is typically a 2x coverage ratio (EBITDA / interest expense), but it may also be a leverage test. The ratio test is an incurrence covenant and is only relevant when the issuer is attempting to raise more debt. 

This covenant should tell you whether debt can be incurred by non-guarantor restricted subs  (which would be structurally senior to these notes). 

The second paragraph will give a long list of carveouts and indicate how debt could be issued over and above the ratio test.

*Baskets/Carveouts*
Credit Facilities Basket - this is typically the largest carveout and allows for credit facilities up to some limit. It normally includes loans and bonds.

Existing Debt Basket - will permit all existing debt. 

Capital Lease / Purchase Money Debt Basket - permits debt used to finance asset acquisitions and/or capital leases. 

Acquired Debt Basket - permits debt of an acquired entity if, after completing the transaction,  ratio debt (used in the debt covenant) doesn't get worse.

Refinancing Carveout - permits new financing that refinances debt previously incurred.

Equity Credit Debt - permits debt up to an amount equal to equity contributions to the capital of the issuer.

Non-gaurantor / foreign sub debt - permits capped debt of non-guarantor restricted subs or foreign restricted subs.

General Debt Basket - allows some capped amount of additional debt for any purpose.

Other Carveouts - case by case.
