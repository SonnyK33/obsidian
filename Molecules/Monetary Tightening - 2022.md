Powell will likely be forced to pivot next year. See [[Zervos and Ferguson]]. The balance sheet reduction that the Fed is guiding towards (~3 tr) could cause an impact worth several hundred bps of tightening (see: [[Top Traders Podcast GM 23]]). Unlikely that Fed will go through with that. 

In 12/14's press conference and FOMC release, Powell made it clear that he won't be cutting rates anytime soon and needs to see meaningful reduction in inflation. The main sticking point is in non-housing service inflation which is being driven by a tight labour market.
See [[Labour Actions]]. The dot plot is now showing a terminal rate about 5% for the duration of 2023, above the September dots even though the last CPI print showed inflation was subsiding. A 5% terminal rate for all of 2023 would likely send the economy into a deep recession. They're projecting inflation in the mid-3's next year and unemployment in the mid-4's. Unemployment likely needs to go much higher. The market is betting that he will be forced to abandon these targets and is still pricing in cuts next year. The 2y rate is still 4.3%; well below where it needs to be with a 5% fed funds rate.

The ECB announced a 50 bp cut on 12/14. They're projecting inflation of 4.2% next year but only a 3% terminal rate next year. So unlike the Fed, the ECB is likely not begin aggressive enough in their projections for next year. Alf at Macro Compass (https://twitter.com/MacroAlf/status/1603409716339740672) argues that 50-100bps real rate is needed to bring down inflation, implying a deposit rate in the mid-4's at least. The Fed may need to pivot from its forecasts and the ECB may have to ramp up. The market is expecting the Fed to blink but is only forecasting a 3.25% terminal rate for the ECB. 

The ECB is also reducing bond purchases by $200bn next year. This is happening while governments are increasing fiscal spending to soften the blow from inflation. The net result is a lot more Eurozone debt for sale to private investors. Estimates are from 500-600bn versus 200bn this year. This will drive all European bond yields higher, especially those in the periphery. Italy may be most at risk with high debt levels - 150% of GDP.

When China entered WTO in 2001, was the start of cheap goods on the west. Western central banks were afraid of deflation and so lowered rates - this has led to excess leverage 
- Walter bagehot- Lombard street - argued central banks should lend at higher rates against good collateral 
	- The first treatise on what central banks should do
- Fed is reducing balance sheet by a third from 9.5tr and says that’s the equivalent of 25 bps - Crossmark Capital  think it’s actually 500bps and doesn’t think it’ll happen - thinks will crash system and pivot coming in early 2023
- believes there's a 8–9 month lag between fed policy and change in market though is faster if returning funds to system that’s been deprived

**Limitations from Raising Rates**
- stock vs flow effect 
	- stock effect refers to effects of higher rates on household and corporate wealth
		- for now, this seems to have levelled off 
	- the flow effect is the impact of incremental tightening
	- higher rates mean that corporates are collecting higher interest income on their cash balances and hence higher rates are subsidizing some
	- at some point, higher rates have the opposite impact 
	- this is the argument made by #Turkey for why not raising rates
- may mean Fed needs to do more aggressive hikes

Lower labour force participation rates and stronger unions mean a higher rate of natural unemployment. Powell said this himself at the Brookings speech in Noveber.
