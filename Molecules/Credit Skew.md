In Hari's **Second Leg Down**, he highlights being short skew after a sell-off as a good trade. Skew is usually elevated post sell-off due to demand for downside protection.

If we look at bonds from a "merton model" perspective, can we come up with an analogue for this trade in credit?

Owning a bond is equivalent to being short a put struck at the face value of debt through that tranche. The underlying in this case is the asset value of the issuer. When the asset value falls below the strike price, you take a loss. Using the same logic, the equity is a call option struck at the total face value of debt. If you graph the implied volatilities of the debt and equity securities against their strike price, you can see the volatility skew. 

Being short skew would mean desiring lower implied vol for lower strike puts. That is, being short these puts or long the senior debt (lower strike price). So short skew translates to a decompression trade. 

Being long skew in credit  would mean desiring higher implied vol for lower strike puts (more senior debt as has a lower attachment point) and lower implied vol for higher strike puts (more junior debt as has more debt and hence a higher attachment point). Wanting higher IV means being long the put - that is, being short the debt. So you want to be short the senior debt and long the junior debt. So long skew in this case is equivalent to a compression trade (or a mean-reversion trade). 

This seems obvious - after a sell-off, mean reversion tends to make sense. However, the current consensus is for decompression trades in credit. That could be because the S&P is up 15% from the lows and  HY CDX is 180 from the wides. However, the market is increasingly pricing in a mild recession for next year. Eurobond futures are pricing in cuts next year, and the option-implied probability of a 10%+ drawdown next year is relatively high compared to benign periods. The market is not pricing in a severe crisis though. Selling the odds of a light recession against buying the odds of a severe recession translates to a put spread. Sell a moderately OTM put and buy a further OTM put. That is, long-skew or compression. 

Long (short) skew -> compression (decompression) -> mean-reverting (trending)
