The FX basis is a quantitative measure of the demand for a sovereign's currency over and above others. It provides a quantitative measure of country's desirability (and power) over another. The current high basis over the EUR and JPY are good examples. A USD holder may earn a higher rate on negatively yielding EUR treasuries as he can earn a high basis from lending his USD out in an FX Swap for EUR.
