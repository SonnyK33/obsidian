The FX basis is a quantitative measure of the demand for a sovereign's currency over and above others. It provides a quantitative measure of country's desirability (and power) over another. The current high basis over the EUR and JPY are good examples. A USD holder may earn a higher rate on negatively yielding EUR treasuries as he can earn a high basis from lending his USD out in an FX Swap for EUR. 

The USD dominance may also require the Fed to bail out foreign central banks as they did during covid. If they want the USD to remain dominant, they'll have to rescue foreign banks through their central banks. As foreign banks don't have a depositor base, they're more vulnerable to bank-runs. Any run on these banks will cause them to go to money markets for funding which will push the USD even higher. Their USD loans could also be impaired.
