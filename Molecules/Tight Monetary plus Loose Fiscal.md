[[Dollar's Imperial Circle]]


In the 1980s, there was a period of loose fiscal policy and tight monetary policy (as is the case currently). This led to higher real rates, a stronger dollar, and lower rates of investment. The stronger dollar led to a larger current account deficit, which also implied a savings deficit (S < I). In fact, savings and investment both fell, while consumption rose. This eventually led to the Plaza Accords where US allies agreed to let their currencies appreciate against the dollar. 

What will happen today? China, the best comparable to 1980s Japan, will not cooperate and allow its currency to appreciate to satisfy US domestic needs. A stronger US dollar would ordinarily be negative for emerging markets. But if it leads to more imports from China, it will allow dollars to continue to be recycled into emerging markets. This process was detailed in [[The Rise of Carry]] and implies that risk assets will continue to perform well. The question is how long China can sustain such a large current account surplus (and implied savings surplus). The weak Yuan causes economic growth to accrue to industry and governments over consumers. Over time, consumers may start to demand more. This makes China the key binding constraint in the current global growth model. High levels of Chinese savings, have to either be channeled into exports or higher domestic investment (S - I = X-M). Higher levels of domestic investment has led to more debt, as many investments are unprofitable now. The US will also have a tough time cutting the trade deficit with China. This is a function of the US' large capital surplus that stems from its open capital account. The path to least resistance seems to be the status quo, which means risk-on, especially for emerging markets. 

What would US tariffs against China do? That would shift US imports to another country (and may not meaningfully affect its overall trade deficit), but it would hurt China's trade surplus (check this)
