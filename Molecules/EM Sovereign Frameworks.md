1) Merton Model
Credit spreads on sovereigns, just like corporates, are compensation for betting that asset value won't fall below the strike price. 

2) ROIC/Systems model
Outflows are current account deficits
Inflows are capital account surpluses
The stock is FX reserves

Lower trade deficits may lead to a lower budget deficits and lower yields over time, but the effect wonâ€™t be instant, and vice versa. 

3) Balance of Payments
(S - I) + (T - G) = X-M
Credits spreads should be higher if:
- private savings are lower
- government savings are lower (fiscal deficit)
- current account deficits are higher

Higher fiscal deficits and private savings deficits will require more capital inflows. For EM sovereigns, I should focus on the left side as the independent variables. The key drivers then are: 
1) private savings rate
- what direction is household wealth going in
- how strong are social services
- how strong are labour unions

2) investment opportunities
- is the country good at attracting foreign investment
- are there resources to extract
- how are the insolvency laws
- how high are real rates
	- is there a carry trade

3) fiscal deficit
- how is tax collection
- is there an election coming up
- do pensions make up a large portion of expenditures

Based on the direction of these variables, you should be able to estimate needed capital inflows and required issuance relative to the outstanding stock. 

All of these variables are flows. What are the stocks?
- household wealth
- FX reserves
- outstanding debt
- sovereign wealth funds

A given amount of issuance will affect yields differently depending on how much is already outstanding.
