**Macro Outlook**

- what is rates market pricing in (No more hikes, though market is clearly running hot)
- High fiscal deficits (including interest on new treasuries and IoR) has increased liquidity in the system
- cash cushions + 30 year mortgages have cushioned the impact from higher rates
- Fed will have to increase rates more - until something breaks
- Every time they have a "hawkish pause", the market gets used to higher rates and the wage spiral continues - the circuit needs to be broken 
- what direction is liquidity going in (follow QT, RRP, TGA)
	- RRP absorbed TGA issuance post the debt-ceiling (because of the hawkish pause - fed funds didn't change but treasury yields rose)
	- upside risk now is that money flows from RRP to bank deposits and then into risk assets
		- however lower RRP means less cushion for QT
		- also means that any kind of shock will result in a large flow from treasuries to RRP since the the latter won't change immediately (tied to fed funds)
	- funds going from bank reserves into treasuries means there's a risk that banks have to cut lending at some point
		- can already see this if you follow the various money market rates
		- will see less credit growth eventually from regional banks
		- a piece from the Fed blog saying more banks using the SRP
		- some banks have been forced to use it rather than loans from the FHLB's as the latter requires positive tangible capital, and many small banks have taken losses on their treasury portfolio

-Global outlook - 
- China - 
	- lack of domestic demand has made monetary stimulus useless
	- trying to switch to a consumption model but that requires restructuring their economy, and empowering consumers to the expense of exporters and local governments 
- YCC change in Japan
	- Higher local yields make hedged USD yields less attractive, hence lowering demand for USD credit. Higher policy rates in Japan (which drive hedgers' cost of borrowing) would strengthen the JPY in the forward market, lowering hedging costs. That hasn't happened yet, so the net effect of keeping policy rates steady but raising 10y yields (which will increase corporate yields) is making hedged foreign yields less attractive. 
- BTPs on heavy issuance from the EZ esp Italy
	- TITIM is a good short, but if you distill it into the key question, shorting BTPs is the most asymmetric and liquid
- what regions/sectors/occupations are seeing the most wage inflation
	- which credits does that hit
- high financing costs are making running a levered book challenging
	- a lot of IG bonds are now negative carry, net of financing costs
	- that is, short risk is positive carry 
	- inverted yield curve means being long-vol is positive carry

Themes - (from one note)
1) Housing 
- lack of supply driving builders to invest in more inventory     
- Affordability at all-time lows 
- Differentiating issuers on basis on backlog and geography
- many have been incentivized to build up inventory as they're the only ones with supply; this will hurt if there's is a hard landing    

2) Off-shore drillers 
- Day-rates coming back to pre-crisis levels     
- Many issuers now out of bankruptcy and with better balance sheets     
- Supply of ships is down after extended down-time  
- ODEBRE post-reorg stock pricing in $200k re-contracted day-rates versus $450k current    

3) TMT 
- Immense capex on fiber and spectrum     
- Who will be the winners, and will they achieve scale in time?     
- DISH, LUMEN, ATUS, CHTR, FYBR, VZ

4) US Midstream 
- Could there be stranded midstream infrastructure     
- Credits with LNG exposure could benefit from major secular changes     

5) E&Ps 
- Major dispersion by asset bases 

6) EM Sovs 
- Many sovereigns shouldn’t have large dollar debt loads, but low rates for so long has encouraged this carry trade     
- Has allowed for large fiscal deficits      
- Little focus on increasing domestic savings rates     
- Capital inflows have bailed out governments and made them look "pro-market" 
- short Turkey (may change this), Egypt, Kenya, Nigeria
- long Colombia, Pakistan
    

7) China  
- Stimulus to housing sector has gone down, and with this, the major tailwinds for Cu, Zn, and iron ore
	- especially bad for steel (Cu used more for housing completions)
-  Investment in EM's will either surge (due to dollar holdings) or their savings glut will continue - something to monitor

8) Consumer leisure 
- Cruises are economical vs flights right now, but for how long?     

9) Covenants 
- Years of lax covenants will allow various priming actions – including drop-downs     
- That may postpone defaults and lower recovery values     
- Long the lower tiers of debt vs short the more senior tranches, given the ability to issue      
- There will be dispersion here based on actual assets (I.e. just even with RP capacity, they still have to find lenders) 
- AMC (decompression as tricks are up), Sabre (steepener)
    

10) UK shorts? 
- UK Housing Associations and utilities

I see three scenarios:
1) Base case - sentiment will start to turn as it becomes clear that rate relief isn't coming. There was a lot of hope put into China, but stimulus isn't coming there either. High debt service will start to wear on corporates. As wage inflation starts to exceed goods inflation (which just happened in May), unemployment may start to increase.

	There were $2-3 trillion in excess savings in mid-2021. Some estimates are showing half of this remaining. It could take until mid-2023 for this to be drawn down. The economy also tends to do well in the second half of a President's first term, as they engage in stimulative policies. The IRA and other stimulus bills have made the Fed's job harder. The latest issuance from the TGA (post debt ceiling) came from RRP, so that softened the blow. The risk now though is that any shock to the market will pull liquidity out of the system back into money market funds, since Powell isn't cutting and fed funds will stay high for a while 
	
	This means a recession by Q3-Q4 of this year. Equities and rates will sell off, as there won't be relief from the Fed at first. Historically, the bulk of market declines have come after the first rate cuts (1929, 2000, 2007, not in 1974 due to inflation). The Atlanta nowcast for GDP is showing a range of +1 to -1.5% and the Atlanta Fed is at 0.7%, so not a recession yet. 


2) Left tail - a hard landing / mistake.
Any shock - large sovereign default (e.g. Turkey or Egypt), QT in Europe (BTPs), recession in Germany, devaluation in China (unlikely but possible), crash in lending from regional banks. 


3) Right tail - what's being priced in now.
Goldilocks scenario where lower rates are good for equities (even though it's recession worries that have lowered rates). Essentially the base case continues. Better inflation prints, high real wages, and  unemployment stays low. Seems impossible that PCE will get to the Fed's target without spiking unemployment and causing a recession. But that's what the market is pricing in. 

I think you need to be positioned short and long skew (short lower attachment points - so short BBs, performing HY, IG, senior tranches, etc). IGs in the low 70s look extremely tight and Euro crossover in the low 400s. 

BBs vs BBBs and BBBs vs As are back to spring '22 tights.
Short BB's like Charter and THC secureds.


Up until recently, CCC's were looking cheap relative to HYG, and so it made sense to be long CCC, short BB's, vega-neutral, so maybe 1.5 x 1. Now you should just be short outright but with a bias for the lower attachment points. The long skew hedges against the left tail. Hedge the right tail by being short 5y treasuries, long oil, and eurodollar puts. 
Long china equities, long cheap BBB's (WBD for example) single-B's/CCC's (Dish senior secured). Long some idiosyncratic EM stories - ODEBRE, Argentina. Short some higher attachment point EM's - Brazil.


**Financing Costs/Credit**
Calculate your breakeven on a bond. That is, what spread widening would offset net carry (yield less financing cost). How does that widening compare to Oct/Nov wides?

By that metric, CCC's looked okay a few weeks ago.
Net carry = YTW (13.3%) - repo (5.25%) = ~8%
OAD is 3.1 years, so would need a 270 bps widening to lose 8 pts.
300 bps widening = 1120 bps vs 2022 wides of 1170


Compare that to HYG.
Net carry = 8.7% - 5.25% = 3.5%
Duration is 4 years, so need 75 bps of widening to lose 3 pts. 
75 bps widening = 515 spread vs October wides of 520

HYG is 50% BB, 40% single-B







*Trade Ideas*
Eurodollar market is pricing in a 1.1% probability of rates being above 5% by December. That is, it's pricing in a 99% chance of a recession, since that's the only realistic scenario where the Fed will be cutting. The market doesn't believe in this higher for longer scenario. This should be a good tail hedge. Short term yields are still pricing in cuts this year, depsite the Fed's repeated warnings. 5 year treasuries may have the most downside here, if market prices in higher for longer rates. 

Decompression starting to look more interesting. More specific catalysts in CCC's and not being paid to take BB or single-B risk. Decompression in long skew which seems like the right way to be positioned, given the market is expecting a soft landing.

Margins are starting to decrease and growth is accelerating to the downside. The story is now for non-technology companies. 80% of industry groups are seeing cost growth in excess of sales growth. When earnings growth starts to go negative, the Fed is normally cutting. Higher rates are an additional headwind. 

The industry groups that the biggest margin downside (per Mike Wilson) are autos, energy, and capital goods.
