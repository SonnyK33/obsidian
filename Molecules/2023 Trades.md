- Where are the asymmetric risks for 2023?
	- conflict over Taiwan (getting to be mainstream)
		- Chinese equities already cheap
		- who gets sanctioned by US besides China/Russia
	- hard landing vs short landing 
		- being long skew looks like good risk/return 
		- long unsecured/2nd lien debt vs short 1st lien/secured - not 1:1, want to be "vega-neutral"
	- Eurozone crisis
		- high fiscal deficits + QT + higher rates
		- could reserves fall below acceptable level?
	- structurally sticky inflation
		- getting close to mainstream
		- not priced in 1yr gold skew (which has flattened since 2021)



**Macro Outlook**

- what is rates market pricing in (5y cuts this year)
- what direction is liquidity going in (follow QT, RRP, TGA)
	- debt ceiling delay is providing more liquidity
	- RRP balance will sterilize impact of QT
	- funds going from bank reserves into treasuries means there's a risk that banks have to cut lending at some point
		- can already see this if you follow the various money market rates
		- a piece from the Fed blog saying more banks using the SRP
		- some banks have been forced to use it rather than loans from the FHLB's as the latter requires positive tangible capital, and many small banks have taken losses on their treasury portfolio
		- where are these banks lending?
- YCC change in Japan
	- Higher local yields make hedged USD yields less attractive, hence lowering demand for USD credit. Higher policy rates in Japan (which drive hedgers' cost of borrowing) would strengthen the JPY in the forward market, lowering hedging costs. That hasn't happened yet, so the net effect of keeping policy rates steady but raising 10y yields (which will increase corporate yields) is make hedged foreign yields less attractive. 
- what regions/sectors/occupations are seeing the most wage inflation
	- which credits does that hit
- high financing costs are making running a levered book challenging
	- a lot of IG bonds are now negative carry, net of financing costs
	- that is, short risk is positive carry 
	- inverted yield curve means being long-vol is positive carry

I see three scenarios:
1) Base case - sentiment stays positive with higher real wages, steady employment, and better inflation prints. The China reopening and stronger demand from international markets is seen as a tailwind.
	Equities and rates will be range bound. Spreads are too tight, but there aren't a lot of maturities until 2025. Rates have also rallied a lot (due to recession worries) which has put market in a better mood. The Fed will switch to 25 bps increments which the market will like, but there's no reason for them to cut, which the rates/eurodollar markets is pricing in. At some point, probably by the summer, after a couple of sobering FOMC meetings, it'll be clear that rate relief isn't coming. High debt service will start to wear on corporates. As wage inflation starts to exceed goods inflation (which will prob happen in Q1), unemployment will start to increase.

This means a recession by Q3-Q4 of this year. Equities and rates will sell off, as there won't be relief from the Fed at first.

2) Left tail - a hard landing / mistake.
This could be caused by a illiquidity issue with treasurires, repo rates, or bank reserves. Funds are still locked in the RRP, and its mainly housholds who are withdrawing deposits and to buy treasuries. The Fed has said that QT will continue even if they have to cut rates. That will mean less bank lending, and not in a linear fashion. There's also the chance the Fed makes a technical adjustment to RRP so that the spread between it and IOR is wider. A mistake could also come from oil prices between China reopening and the Russian oil ban.

There are lots of geopolitical flashpoints - Russia/Ukraine, China/Taiwan (less so), or Iran.

In this scenario, S&P crashes, but rates rally hard. 

3) Right tail - what's being priced in now.
Goldilocks scenario where lower rates are good for equities (even though it's recession worries that have lowered rates). Essentially the base case continues. Better inflation prints, high real wages, and  unemployment stays low. Seems impossible that PCE will get to the Fed's target without spiking unemployment and causing a ression. But that's what the market is pricing in. 
Calls on S&P are overpriced because of how high forwards are (because of higher rates).
In this unlikely scenario, rates will not cut as there's no reason for the Fed to cut. Best way to hedge this scenario is long oil, long gold, and short eurodollar futures (or 5 year treasuries).

I think you need to be positioned short and long skew (short lower attachment points - so IG, senior tranches, etc). Up until recently, CCC's were looking cheap relative to HYG, and so it made sense to be long CCC, short BB's, vega-neutral, so maybe 1.5 x 1. Now you should just be short outright but with a bias for the lower attachment points. The long skew hedges against the left tail. Hedge the right tail by being short 5y treasuries, long oil, and eurodollar puts. 
Long china equities, long cheap BBB's (WBD for example) single-B's/CCC's (Dish senior secured).


**Financing Costs/Credit**
Calculate your breakeven on a bond. That is, what spread widening would offset net carry (yield less financing cost). How does that widening compare to Oct/Nov wides?

By that metric, CCC's looked okay a few weeks ago.
Net carry = YTW (13.3%) - repo (4.5%) = ~9%
OAD is 3.3 years, so would need a 300 bps widening to lose 9 pts.
300 bps widening = 1240 bps vs 2022 wides of 1170

Now, YTW is 12.8% - 5% repo = 7.8%
given OAD, needs a 240 widening 
Current OAS is 880, so that would be 1120, inside of 2022 levels

Compare that to HYG.
Net carry = 7.9% - 5% = 3%
Duratio is 4.3 years, so need 70 bps of widening to lose 3 pts. 
70 bps widening = 500 spread vs October wides of 520

HYG is 50% BB, 40% single-B

**2023 Bets**
1) Will the Fed cut rates in 2023?
2) Will the ECB continue tightening?
3) Will Italian government stick to fiscal plan?
4) Will the BoJ abandon YCC?
5) Will Egypt comply with the IMF program?
6) Will Argentenians re-elect current government?


*Trade Ideas*
Eurodollar market is pricing in a 1.1% probability of rates being above 5% by December. That is, it's pricing in a 99% chance of a recession, since that's the only realistic scenario where the Fed will be cutting. The market doesn't believe in this higher for longer scenario. This should be a good tail hedge. Short term yields are still pricing in cuts this year, depsite the Fed's repeated warnings. 5 year treasuries may have the most downside here, if market prices in higher for longer rates. 

Decompression starting to look more interesting. More specific catalysts in CCC's and not being paid to take BB or single-B risk. Decompression in long skew which seems like the right way to be positioned, given the market is expecting a soft landing.
