What's my framework for assessing variable outcomes? A credit which has more variable outcomes should trade at a higher spread than one with narrower outcomes, all else equal. The other variables include moneyness and time to maturity. I should break up the credits into categories based on those variables so I'm comparing like for like credits. But then how to determine how variable a credit's outcomes are in a systematic fashion?
The rough framework I have in my head is:

Macro (GDP, inflation, wages) -> sectoral (shifting trends) -> issuer (topline, financial and operating leverage, and liquidity)

Start with macro outcomes, but keep it simple. For now, there can be soft and hard landing outcomes. Then go through each sector, and think about how they're affected by different macro outcomes as well as sector-specific issues. This work should give you a range of values for an issuer's topline and COGS components. The issuer's fixed cost leverage and liquidity will then give specific outcomes for that name. In this framework, outcomes become more variable as you move from macro to issuer-specific. 

This framework will not calculate a specific spread, but it will help for relative value across sectors, ratings, geographies, etc.

**Sectoral Scenarios**
What are the different trends in a given sector.
