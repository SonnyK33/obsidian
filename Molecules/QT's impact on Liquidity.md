The Fed is currently engaging in quantitative tightening which is thought to be reducing liquidity. The argument is, as the Fed buys back treasuries, that reduces bank reserves, which will lead to less lending and a lower money supply. However, the link between bank reserves and M2 money supply was disrupted when the Fed started paying interest on reserves. When reserves earned nothing, banks were incentivized to generate income by lending money. That created deposits and increased the money supply. When the Fed started paying interest on reserves, this was no longer necessary (as became apparent post-GFC). The inverse shouldn't be true either. As more reserves didn't imply more lending, fewer reserves shouldn't  imply less lending (as long as minimum liquidity standards are met)
