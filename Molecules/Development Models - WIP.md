[[Framework]]

Countries' development models can be broken into two categories. First, countries who have investment needs and opportunities. Second, countries with excess savings relative to investment opportunities. 

Those in the first group are generally known as emerging markets. They are characterized by young populations with unmet needs. High levels of poverty keep consumption rates high relative to income which creates domestic demand. 




The equation tying the trade balance with the savings balance:
trade deficit = capital surplus = investment - private savings - (T - G)

Are capital flows driving the economy, or is it the reverse? That is, are there profitable investment opportunities (at the local cost of capital), which are luring in foreign capital, or are capital flows making unprofitable investments seem viable? Even worse, are capital flows just fueling consumption and imports?

**How are Investments Financed**
[[Trade balances and Capital Flows]]
Countries could finance trade deficits with local currency debt which is equivalent to a company paying for stuff with its own equity. It makes that currency, can control how much they pay on it, and could default or devalue as it’s likely under local law. But like issuing equity, this is expensive. It’s cheaper to use debt which is equivalent to FX borrowing where you don’t organically produce the currency. Local currency debt also puts skin in the game the way equity is. FX debt can play a constructive role in development, but it is a carry trade [[The Rise of Carry]] with all of the associated risks.

The nature of investments is thus key to analyzing a country's internal and external balances:
What are the investment opportunities?
Are they satisfying unmet needs? If no, consumption is likely low relative to income. 
How are they being financed? FDI and local currency debt are analogous to equity and FX debt is classic debt. 

**Drivers of Growth Model**
1) Allocation of national income by household, business, and government 



**Constraints**
A country's development or growth model is a function of its history and its constraints. China has capital controls as they don't want to see a capital exodus, nor do they want to lose control of key assets to foreign entities. A relatively closed capital account makes it impossible for foreign countries to store their savings in RMB.
