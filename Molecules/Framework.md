**Evaluating Credits**
Management controls corporate actions, and is driven by incentives and are limited by constraints. They're almost focused on increasing equity value. Using the Merton framework, equity is a call on assets. The value of this call can be increased by:
1) increasing the value of the underlying assets
2) increasing the volatility of asset returns
3) increasing the time until expiry
4) decreasing the strike (decreasing debt)

The last one category is equivalent to decreasing the volatility of asset returns, as that results in more dependable FCF, which will increase the potential for deleveraging. 

1) Increasing asset value. This normally requires decreasing the volatility of FCF, and so will only be done when gamma is high and vega is low. That is, when the equity is close to ATM (very low equity value), and the expiry on the equity call is rapidly approaching (say due to an imminent maturity). If there aren't any liquidity worries, vega will be high, and management will be reluctant to decrease volatility. 

	Increasing asset value requires (1) increasing invested capital by changing inflows net of outflows or (2)  better capital allocation. The first means means growing EBIT (inflows of capital) vs dividends and interest expense (outflows). If dividends have already been cut, management's choices are cutting interest expense with bond buybacks (if they're generating cash), cutting fixed operating costs (layoffs, etc), or growing gross profit via higher prices or higher quantities. Better capital allocation means accretive capex or M&A. M&A is a function of the availability of targets and cheap currency (either high equity multiples or low cost of funding). Capex is similar in that to be deployed efficiently there needs to be a good opportunity set. Unless management is entering into a new market, capital allocation likely won't add value if the first avenue is closed. That is, if ROIC is already below interest and dividends, it's unlikely new investments in the same vertical will be different. 

	Can management increase asset value simultaneously with increasing the volatility of returns? Accretive M&A may be an example. 

Is there a grid? On one axis - ITM vs OTM equity calls. On the other, short or long time to expiry?


Use the Asset Return and Capital Allocation frameworks to find the binding constraints or lynch-pins. Once the Asset Return framework is complete, think about asymmetry and upside/downside scenarios. If you're long the credit, you're willing to receive the credit spread in exchange for taking on the risk that the volatility increases and/or the asset value falls. 

Examples
1) Cemex
This is a HY credit that's about to be upgraded. The equity is easily ITM and there are no liquidity issues. IG credits would fall into this box. Management wants to increase equity value, as always. The biggest bang for their buck will come from increasing the volatility of returns through growth. That's a major difference between IG and HY credits. 



**Asset Returns**
Returns come from carry and capital appreciation.

Appreciation comes from lowering the volatility of asset returns which lowers spreads.

A long credit position is equivalent to selling a put struck at the corresponding debt/asset ratio. The underlying is value of the business’ assets.

FCF captures asset returns and is a function of the operating assets, capital structure, and trends in target markets

FCF + capital allocation = funds available for debt

FCF = Quantity of goods (Prices – var cost) – fixed operating costs – capex – interest expense – cash taxes

Capital allocation is decided by management. Capital can be spent on:

1. Shareholder returns
2. Expansionary capex
3. M&A
4. Debt paydown

The first three decrease funds available for creditors and increase volatility of returns. New assets and businesses are uncertain (capex and M&A). Shareholder returns reduce future buffers for loss absorption.

We need to break every credit into these fundamentals.

1. Gross profit

This is a function of quantity, prices, and variable costs.

Gross profit can increase via:

1. Higher prices

1. Standard economic Inflation
2. Ability of industry to over-earn
3. Ability of individual issuer to exert extra pricing pressure

3. Higher quantities

1. population growth

                                                                           i.      base rate of growth in markets

                                                                         ii.      population moving into target markets

                                                                       iii.      issuer moving into new markets

                                                                       iv.      issuer stealing share from competitors

3. lower variable costs

1. wage deflation

                                                                           i.      unemployment trends

2. goods deflation

                                                                           i.      commodity prices

                                                                         ii.      easing logistical pressures

2. Fixed operating costs

This can be reduced by cutting staff or closing facilities

3. Capex

Break into maintenance versus expansionary. The latter is a capital allocation decision.

1. Maintenance capex

1. This should remain steady
