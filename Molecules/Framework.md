1) First answer the big questions
	1) What sector is this credit in, and what are the macroeconomic drivers?
		1) have they moved a lot in one direction?
			1) are you expecting mean reversion or the trend to continue, and why?
	2) what different states of the world (and the macro drivers) can you imagine?
		1) what evidence would you need to see to weigh one of those states higher than others
	3) Based on the first two, are you bullish/bearish on the sector in short term (1-3 months)? the medium term (6m - 1 yr)?
	4) If credit is a sovereign or has operations in an EM, you need to have a view on the sovereign first
2) Start with the most liquid credits in that sector - see [[Credit Buckets]]
3) For different credits, depending on their rating, break out the macro vs idiosyncratic factors (see [[Macro vs Idiosyncratic]])
4) Determine upside/downside on the most liquid credits, which will likely be based on the macro drivers identified above. The potential return should be compared against the spread (see [[Credit Scoring]]. Less liquid credits will be judged against these potential returns.
5) For the idiosyncratic factors, see [[Evaluating Credits]] and the [[Merton Model for Management Incentives]]
6) Again use [[Credit Scoring]] to assess the asymmetry in potential idiosyncratic trades.
7) Beyond the upside/downside, is there convexity in the trade [[Convexity]] ? 
8) Trade construction (pairs, tenors, curves, etc)
