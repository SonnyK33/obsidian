Questions to Ask:
- Where is the asymmetric risk and are you being compensated for it?
- if you take the risk and you're right, how much do you make? how much do you lose?
	- what does that imply about the odds being priced in?
	- are those odds consistent with other parts of the market?
	- e.g. short-vol has asymmetric risk, and so you're paid a VRP for taking it
		- VIX term structure is upward sloping because you need to be compensated for being short it
- compensation for the risk should be proportional to how asymmetric it is not the absolute upside/downside (which are prone to more forecast errors anyways)


- fundamentals - focus on the variance around estimates rather than their mean
	- hard to just do a better job at predicting a company's EBITDA esp given how much coverage liquid credits have
	- instead I try to determine how risky those estimates are
		- what is the range for sales, costs, etc
		- what is the range for EBITDA, a FCF and where should things trade in the extremes of that range
		- based on that, is there asymmetry?
	- it doesn't matter what next year's EBITDA is, that's unknowable - what matters is the degree to which it can be estimated and the range of possible outcomes
		- that's how you price risk and look for trading opportunities 
- by being a generalist, have a better sense of how to price risk
	- risk-free vs IG vs HY
	- DM vs EM 
	- high beta vs low beta credits
