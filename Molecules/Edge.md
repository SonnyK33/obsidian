I lead a team focused on HY and EM credit. I'm responsible for trade idea generation and portfolio management. These strategies use roughly $800-$1bn in capital (4-5bn GMV). 
Total firm is ~25bn GMV. I have two research analysts, and am hiring 1-2 more by year-end. I also leverage our analytics group for building screens and "quantamental" strategies (e.g. HY CDX members that have underperformed their beta). 

I try to be long volatility and short carry-trades. I look for convexity - longs at low cash prices with strong recovery, and shorts whose upside is capped or which will look like even better shorts as the market sells off (e.g. high coupon bonds in the high 90s). I have an EM background, and leverage that in my process. Most EM sovereigns are dressed up carry-trades, which are wholly dependent on capital flows from the money centers. 15 years of low rates has incentivized many to run large fiscal and current account deficits, funded by investors looking for yield. The accumulation of reserves allowed many to prop of their currency, further perpetuating the carry trade. That's what we see in Turkey and Egypt right now. 

I'm focused on process and coming up with systems that work. Bottoms-up fundamental research sometimes has the veneer of being a bespoke, artisanal process. But in order to scale up, you need a process and systems. You also need to pay attention to what works and what doesn't. This is especially true as you build a team. I've worked as part of different research teams in the past, and I have a good sense of what works. We're very focused on liquidity as that can be more important than pure fundamentals in HY credit. 

I've divided research work into different buckets; roughly - 1) HY/distressed, 2) BBB/crossover credits, 3) New Issues, and 4) EM sovereigns. And I have templates and work-flows for each of them. For example, for HY names, a lot more time is spent on bottoms-up fundamentals (what are the industry drivers, financial and operating leverage, liquidity risks) and legal documents (can you be primed?). I have a blueprint that my analysts use for for analyzing indentures and covenants. For BBB names, it's more important to understand rating agency thresholds and capital allocation guidance from management. For sovereigns, need to understand drivers of the current account, what are the political constraints that drive the savings rate and fiscal balance?

From a distance, many of these credits looks like disparate situations - a satellite company, a pharmacy, a Middle Eastern sovereign. My job is pattern recognition, and being able to abstract across all of these situations and look for convexity. 


**Process**
Macro -> themes -> sectors -> liquid capital structures -> credits at inflection points -> convexity

Get questions from specific credits and then abstract back to thematic level. 

We invest thematically by thinking about the big questions driving a group of credits. That allows us to scale and cover a larger universe. For example, we started looking at Celanese a BBB- credit that could become a crossover. It's easy to get lost in the details - as it's involved in a bunch of different chemical chains. But as I took a step back, I realized this is a deleveraging story (would require a massive sell-off for it to be FCF negative). From there we started looking at more generic chemical chains, that led to polyethylene which is the basic building block of plastics. There's an argument that a lot of supply is coming online as demand is collapsing in North America and Europe. There are much larger credits in which we can play this theme (LYB, Ineos, Braskem, etc). There's even a distressed name in Mexico (BAKIDE) which is in the 60s; it's probably going in the 30s, but it will be an interesting asset as it's part of NAFTA and will benefit from friendshoring. 

That's how we come up with themes. It's a process - what are the key questions? Is there a more generalizable question that applies to more credits? 

engineered materials demand? -> polymer demand? -> Chinese demand
Chinese demand -> winners and losers across polymers 


**How to do Research**
It requires deep domain knowledge, but more importantly, you need to spend the time upfront to make sure you're looking for the right information. It's easy to get lost with too much content and building overly complex models where you miss the patterns. That's why it's important to use templates and common processes. I then come up with the key questions, hypotheses, and determine what evidence would be dispositive between different hypotheses. 


**What hasn't worked**
Predominantly "value" trades (in either direction). Trades with no catalyst but which just looked expensive or cheap. I didn't spend enough time thinking about why they were trading where they were. 


**Wrong price vs wrong forecasts**
Always looking for the most liquid way to put a view on - often through index or ETFs. Look at RV between CCCs and HYG for instance to make sure that a CCC is actually "wide". 
The best fundamental trades should be based on non-consensus views and forecasts. Some trades may be based on the "wrong" price, even if you think consensus forecasts are correct. However, in most cases, those trades are probably better expressed through index. That is, if one highly levered BB credit looks too tight given its expected financials, likely all BB's trade too tight, and there's a better trade at the macro level.
Focus on forming non-consensus views.

The "assets at extremes" methodology looks for assets whose pricing is close to an inflection point. They may be a good proxy for credits where there is disagreement on where it's heading and there's a chance to form non-consensus views. When you distill those assets to the key questions, the next step is to determine the consensus answers to those questions.


**Portfolio Management**
The book should reflect your base macro case with hedges against extreme events that aren't priced in. Conceptually, everyone is expecting a shallow recession at this point - or as some are calling it -immaculate disinflation. I like being long skew - in option terms - selling a put spread. Long risk for higher attachment points (either HY names that will do okay or BBB names with a strong deleveraging story - WBD, Celanese, BAKIDE eventually) and short risk lower attachment points (Ineos, LYB, Braskem). 
Right now, short risk / long vol is actually flat to positive carry because of funding costs. 

A size trades based on expected loss. How much am I willing to lose on a trade if I'm wrong? From that I can back into what the size should be. Something should be large if I'm willing to lose a decent amount if I'm wrong. 

Trades in book should each be the cleanest and most asymmetric expression for a given view.
If you think labour inflation will continue, to be an issue, what's the best way to express that?
- CYH, HCA, SBUX
EM Sovereign carry trades
- Kenya, Turkey, Nigeria
Offshore drillers have upside risk, onshore drillers are hurt by financing costs
- Odebrecht, RIG vs NBR


**Performance**
2023 performance is decent, we haven't given public numbers yet. But in line with the last couple of years. 

Compass performance last year was ~10pct. My PnL was 19m. Max drawdown was 1%.

In 2021, my PnL was $16 and that was 22% return on capital (as we were smaller back then). 
Drawdown was 1.2%.

And 2020 here I was ~23m, which was a 51% return on capital (the whole firm was 200m AUM back then).


**Other Details**
 - These strategies use roughly $800-$1bn in capital (4-5bn GMV). 
 - Total firm is ~25bn GMV
 - I need 1-2 analysts to run liquid HY in US, and some EUR
 - 300-500m capital to start, including use of index/ETF products
 - why leaving - excited to start something new, credit is a new silo, so it's interesting to be a part of something from the ground-up. I have a lot of ideas on the investment side and why there's a lot to do, but also on process and building a team. I also like your firm's quant/technology background because credit is the last frontier for quant investing. There's a lot that can be done algorithmically to track liquidity, dealer quotes, some fundamental factors (buy the cheapest bonds in a group, sell the most expensive), etc. 





**Fundamental Factors**
1) What is pricing power?
2) Operating leverage 
	a) what are fixed vs variable expenses?
	b) at what point do fixed costs become variable?
	c) what are the inflection points for when fixed costs change (e.g. need more staff if revenue gets to a certain point
3) Are there major changes to factors of production 
	a) labour
	b) raw materials
1) What are capex plans
2) What is the working capital cycle
3) Capital structure
	a) financing costs
	b) maturities and refinancing needs 

Once a possible trade has been identified, questions to ask:
- Where is the asymmetric risk and are you being compensated for it?
- if you take the risk and you're right, how much do you make? how much do you lose?
	- what does that imply about the odds being priced in?
	- are those odds consistent with other parts of the market?
	- e.g. short-vol has asymmetric risk, and so you're paid a VRP for taking it
		- VIX term structure is upward sloping because you need to be compensated for being short it
- compensation for the risk should be proportional to how asymmetric it is not the absolute upside/downside (which are prone to more forecast errors anyways)


- fundamentals - focus on the variance around estimates rather than their mean
	- hard to just do a better job at predicting a company's EBITDA especially given how much coverage liquid credits have
	- instead I try to determine how risky those estimates are
		- what is the range for sales, costs, etc
		- what is the range for EBITDA, FCF and where should things trade in the extremes of that range
		- based on that, is there asymmetry?
	- it doesn't matter what next year's EBITDA is, that's unknowable - what matters is the degree to which it can be estimated and the range of possible outcomes
		- that's how you price risk and look for trading opportunities 
- by being a generalist, have a better sense of how to price risk
	- risk-free vs IG vs HY
	- DM vs EM 
	- high beta vs low beta credits
  

Examples  

Most obvious are political leaders making monetary or fiscal policy for sovereigns. 
Workers demanding higher wages (choice forcing central bank leaders to tighten).
Investors purchasing risk assets (forcing leaders to tighten) .
Public moving deposits into treasuries (forcing banks to raise deposit rates, forcing banks to lower spending, may force central banks to eventually slow down QT).
Important not to see forecasting as making predictions about random factors but rather real people.   

What’s governing those decisions? What are their choices? What info do you need to predict which choice they’ll make? What are their constraints? What matters to them? Info is only 


For IG credit it may seem as though fundamentals don't matter since they are not at the "extreme". However they can still trade at extreme levels (close to a downgrade, biggest out/underperformer etc). A good examples is WBD; it's an improving credit story (simple fundamental analysis will show that) but it also got to extreme levels.

So for a fundamental analyst, the most important thing is to know where to focus. Focus on the extremes (Distressed, high quality credits which trade too tight, crossover credits, those whose equities have fallen a lot, etc).
