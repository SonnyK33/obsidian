What are the drivers of a credit? What factors can be abstracted across different sectors and even asset classes (corporates, sovereigns, equities, etc)



**Fundamental Factors**
1) What is pricing power?
2) Operating leverage 
	a) what are fixed vs variable expenses?
	b) at what point do fixed costs become variable?
	c) what are the inflection points for when fixed costs change (e.g. need more staff if revenue gets to a certain point
3) Are there major changes to factors of production 
	a) labour
	b) raw materials
1) What are capex plans
2) What is the working capital cycle
3) Capital structure
	a) financing costs
	b) maturities and refinancing needs 
		


1) Wrong price vs wrong forecasts
The best fundamental trades should be based on non-consensus views and forecasts. Some trades may be based on the "wrong" price, even if you think consensus forecasts are correct. However, in most cases, those trades are probably better expressed through index. That is, if one highly levered BB credit looks too tight given its expected financials, likely all BB's trade too tight, and there's a better trade at the macro level.
Focus on forming non-consensus views.

The "assets at extremes" methodology looks for assets whose pricing is close to an inflection point. They may be a good proxy for credits where there is disagreement on where it's heading and there's a chance to form non-consensus views. When you distill those assets to the key questions, the next step is to determine the consensus answers to those questions.

2) What's consensus?
Can use options to find implied probabilities.
Right now, rate cuts along with a soft landing is consensus. That seems contradictory; nevertheless, that's consensus. Rate cuts  imply a taming in wage inflation. Where do you disagree with that?




2) Process
Part of an investment team that trades long/short credit - across credit quality, sectors, and regions. My focus is on more fundamentally driven themes, and so I spend more time on cross-over and HY situations. Have a background in EM, so also lead EM trades - Latam, some CEEMEA (Ukraine, Turkey, Belarus, GCC). Incorporate a lot of macro into my investment style, including beta/macro/index trades when relevant. 

Try to distill trades into a series of bets. What are you betting on? What is the best way to put that risk on? See [[2023 Trades]] for current bets. 

Start with things trading at extremes. Distill the trade decision into a few questions - be as specific and fundamental as possible. Do this for  all trades and then look for the most popular questions. 
If you’re being sufficiently abstract and fundamental, there should be lots of common questions. Come up with alternate hypotheses.  Come up with a distribution of outcomes and compare with asset prices.  


Once a possible trade has been identified, questions to ask:
- Where is the asymmetric risk and are you being compensated for it?
- if you take the risk and you're right, how much do you make? how much do you lose?
	- what does that imply about the odds being priced in?
	- are those odds consistent with other parts of the market?
	- e.g. short-vol has asymmetric risk, and so you're paid a VRP for taking it
		- VIX term structure is upward sloping because you need to be compensated for being short it
- compensation for the risk should be proportional to how asymmetric it is not the absolute upside/downside (which are prone to more forecast errors anyways)


- fundamentals - focus on the variance around estimates rather than their mean
	- hard to just do a better job at predicting a company's EBITDA especially given how much coverage liquid credits have
	- instead I try to determine how risky those estimates are
		- what is the range for sales, costs, etc
		- what is the range for EBITDA, FCF and where should things trade in the extremes of that range
		- based on that, is there asymmetry?
	- it doesn't matter what next year's EBITDA is, that's unknowable - what matters is the degree to which it can be estimated and the range of possible outcomes
		- that's how you price risk and look for trading opportunities 
- by being a generalist, have a better sense of how to price risk
	- risk-free vs IG vs HY
	- DM vs EM 
	- high beta vs low beta credits
  

Examples  

Most obvious are political leaders making monetary or fiscal policy for sovereigns. 
Workers demanding higher wages (choice forcing central bank leaders to tighten).
Investors purchasing risk assets (forcing leaders to tighten) .
Public moving deposits into treasuries (forcing banks to raise deposit rates, forcing banks to lower spending, may force central banks to eventually slow down QT).
Important not to see forecasting as making predictions about random factors but rather real people.   

What’s governing those decisions? What are their choices? What info do you need to predict which choice they’ll make? What are their constraints? What matters to them? Info is only 


For IG credit it may seem as though fundamentals don't matter since they are not at the "extreme". However they can still trade at extreme levels (close to a downgrade, biggest out/underperformer etc). A good examples is WBD; it's an improving credit story (simple fundamental analysis will show that) but it also got to extreme levels.

So for a fundamental analyst, the most important thing is to know where to focus. Focus on the extremes (Distressed, high quality credits which trade too tight, crossover credits, those whose equities have fallen a lot, etc).


Macro analysis is a big part of my framework which comes from my EM background and because I still look at sovereigns. For credit, macro analysis is focused on credit and liquidity as well as market technicals. 

2) **Portfolio Management**
The book should reflect your base macro case with hedges against extreme events that aren't priced in. Conceptually, everyone is expecting a shallow recession at this point - or as some are calling it -immaculate disinflation. I like being long skew - in option terms - selling a put spread. Long risk for higher attachment points (either HY names that will do okay or BBB names with a strong deleveraging story) and short risk lower attachment points (IG names, dead credits like HOG or GLD). 
Right now, short risk / long vol is actually flat to positive carry. 

A size trades based on expected loss. How much am I willing to lose on a trade if I'm wrong? From that I can back into what the size should be. Something should be large if I'm willing to lose a decent amount if I'm wrong. 

Trades in book should each be the cleanest and most asymmetric expression for a given view.
If you think labour inflation will continue, to be an issue, what's the best way to express that?
- CYH, HCA, SBUX, WYNN
China will play a larger role in lending to EM and running restructuring processes
- Kenya, Egypt
Oil has upside risk
- CS long / Egypt short
Debt ceiling + higher inflation vol + flight from treasuries
- HCA, UNH
China/US conflict will continue
- Japanese fiscal deficit will rise -> will have to abandon YCC
	- inflation follows Australian CPI which spiked

**Why?**

I think fundamental credit analysis and differentiation across names will be very important in 2023. HIgher rates, ongoing supply-chain issues, higher inflation, etc mean that in depth research will be important again. For the first time since the GCF, there will be a lot of interesting opportunities in HY/distressed. I think my EM background also gives me a good  macro toolkit for next year.

Our bread and butter has always been IG (despite my focus), and when I read about your background, I thought it could be interesting for next year.

I want to be a risk taker and there will be a lots of opportunities in credit with fed funds rate > 5%. 
  

3) My focus areas

- EM differentiation

-   experience - ARGY/VENZ/UKRAIN/TURKEY/ODEBRE
-   first to move in either direction
-   macroeconomic analysis useful for new world order

-   FX risk, inflation pass through etc, effects on margins

-   next year - 

-   longs - Argentina, Pemex, maybe VENZ, ODEBRE
-   shorts/defaults - Egypt, Pakistan, Poland
