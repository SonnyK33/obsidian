Questions to Ask:
- Where is the asymmetric risk and are you being compensated for it?
- if you take the risk and you're right, how much do you make? how much do you lose?
	- what does that imply about the odds being priced in?
	- are those odds consistent with other parts of the market?
	- e.g. short-vol has asymmetric risk, and so you're paid a VRP for taking it
		- VIX term structure is upward sloping because you need to be compensated for being short it
- compensation for the risk should be proportional to how asymmetric it is not the absolute upside/downside (which are prone to more forecast errors anyways)


- fundamentals - focus on the variance around estimates rather than their mean
	- hard to just do a better job at predicting a company's EBITDA esp given how much coverage liquid credits have
	- instead I try to determine how risky those estimates are
		- what is the range for sales, costs, etc
		- what is the range for EBITDA, a FCF and where should things trade in the extremes of that range
		- based on that, is there asymmetry?
	- it doesn't matter what next year's EBITDA is, that's unknowable - what matters is the degree to which it can be estimated and the range of possible outcomes
		- that's how you price risk and look for trading opportunities 
- by being a generalist, have a better sense of how to price risk
	- risk-free vs IG vs HY
	- DM vs EM 
	- high beta vs low beta credits


Try to distill trades into a series of bets. What are you betting on? What is the best way to put that risk on? See [[2023 Trades]] for current bets.



Fundamentals matter most at the extremes. When an asset is too cheap/expensive to ignore. Too expensive only matters for credit, as equities can't really get so expensive that no one will buy them (as last year showed). When something is so cheap that CF will keep it from defaulting or will allow it to rapidly distribute cash to shareholders, fundamentals matter. When they're so expensive that there's literally no upside left, fundamentals matter. There's always upside left on equities with a strong narrative whcih is why "too expensive" doesn't really matter for equities. 

For IG credit it may seem as though fundamentals don't matter since they are not at the "extreme". However they can still trade at extreme levels (close to a downgrade, biggest out/underperformer etc). A good examples is WBD; it's an improving credit story (simple fundamental analysis will show that) but it also got to extreme levels.

So for a fundamental analyst, the most important thing is to know where to focus. Focus on the extremes (Distressed, high quality credits which trade too tight, crossover credits, those whose equities have fallen a lot, etc)
