With the exception of a few oil exporters, no country got rich without industrializing, that is, building a strong manufacturing sector. Manufacturing has 3 advantages over service and agriculture:
 
1) increasing returns from each marginal unit of labour and guarantees convergence with rich countries 
 2) compared to ecological and national limits for agriculture and service, manufacturing creates tradable goods and hence has much more potential 
3) can absorb large portions of the population even the unskilled  
   
The vast majority of economic development came from China and East Asian economies who built manufacturing sectors. Many of the exceptions relied on the commodity boom of 2000-15 which is also due to China.

In retrospect, economic performance was much stronger for the developing world from 1950-1980 when Bretton Woods prevailed and capital mobility was limited. It allowed for financial stability, and countries were free from boom and bust cycles. Had Brazil grown at the same rate as it did in the 1970s it would be richer than the UK today.

Forty years earlier, the end of Bretton Woods and the energy shocks of late 1970s created the great inflation. This led to Volker’s hikes which raised debt servicing costs and killed the commodity cycle. The hikes in the US cut inflation but also created recessions, unemployment, and lower commodity prices.

After the Volcker shock, the commodity boom ended and expansionary fiscal policy ended around the developing world. This led to defaults and state collapse. There were conflicts throughout post-Soviet states, Latin America, and especially in Africa. Some countries reacted by liberalizing their capital accounts which led to more volatility, as in Mexico and Russia. Structural adjustment plans and shock therapy also destroyed state capacity and industrialization. In extreme examples, like Somalia, whole states were replaced with international aid organizations.

With the exception of China and some in east Asia, many developing countries prematurely de-industrialized (Rodrik). Workers everywhere were displaced by China. At the same time, de-agrarionization occurred. Capital intensity of post green revolution farming meant farmers needed expensive fertilizers and were forced to specialize into cash crops. The fiscal adjustments also removed subsidies and tariffs. This led to rapid increases urbanization and created slums around the world.

Many countries’ only alternatives were commodity exports and low skill services. In 1995, oil and iron ore were less that 5pct of Brazil's exports vs 20pct in 2020. This worked because of the commodity super cycle in 2000-15 fueled by China. But when China slowed in 2015, and shale killed oil prices, there were economic crises throughout Latin America, accompanied by political instability. The pink tide ended. Budget crises in Nigeria and Iraq hurt their ability to deal with insurgencies. The commodity export model isn’t sustainable.

Commodity companies were not able to absorb large numbers of skilled and especially unskilled workers the way manufacturing and agriculture did. The excess labour then was forced into the service sector. While we associate that with the call centers and IT back offices in India, more often it’s a euphemism for informal work. Small time merchants, taxi drivers, etc., make up the bulk. 90 pct of the jobs created in India since it liberalized in 1991 were in the informal sector. This group has been romanticized into micro-entrepreneurs but in reality their livelihood is insecure and they’re very close to extreme poverty, despite not being picked up in the stats.

Services don’t have the productivity enhancement that manufacturing has. It’s led to an explosion in debt/income with the advent of credit and lots of idle men. They’re vulnerable to scams and are targets for extremists (my point).

Indeed, it’s led to gangs in Central America, narco groups in Mexico, Islamic militants in the Middle East, Boko Haram in Nigeria, and communal violence in India. It’s also led to a large migration movement. Those who weren’t able to get to Europe or the US, go to neighboring states which are often only mildly more stable. It’s also led to large urban slums. The migrant flows have made some countries wholly reliant on remittances. El Salvador gets a quarter of its GDP from Salvadorans abroad, mainly in the U.S. This in turn ties those countries to volatile capital flows (my point). Kerala’s growth model is increasingly reliant on sending its young men to work as laborers in the Persian gulf.

Each wave of industrialization has been weaker than the last. The previous thinking was that cheap labour was the key comparative advantage for manufacturing and thus every country would get its turn. However, changing consumer tastes, less control over the domestic economy (due to open capital accounts), and automation have weakened successive industrializations.

The East Asian economies along with China also benefited from special conditions. They started as rural societies with a peasant class eager to work. The rural landlords were displaced with land reform (this is a key point - link with South African note). State capacity was high, and they didn’t compete with large private business interests. The societies were healthy due to large investments in public health and education. State capacity was high even though they’re poor.

The few recent success stories have been Vietnam and other SE Asian states, and to a lesser extent, Bangladesh. Vietnam in particular stands out with comparable growth to China with less corruption than during the Jintao years. Bangladesh has done a good job with garments but has failed to expand to higher value exports. It’s also too reliant on informal businesses which do not benefit from guaranteed productivity enhancement. These countries now risk though being stuck in middle income status. Korea is the one example (along with China) that managed to transition to high skilled manufacturing which it did in the 80s and 90s. The challenge is to develop new coalitions and not allow vested interests from blocking progress.

That’s what’s happened to countries who are never escaped middle income status. Mexico, Brazil, and Egypt for example all have elites who rival the state for power. Informalism is high and elites have no interest in developing new industries or educating the masses. Many are stuck as commodity exporters. India has rural elites and real estate tycoons along with endemic inequality. 

Poorer countries in Africa have it even worse. State capacity is very low and completely run by a handful of elites. They have no interest in further development. Labor costs per worker are higher in Africa than in Bangladesh even at much lower levels of per capita GDP. Many of these states have lost the monopoly on violence and are run by violent gangs. This emerged from slums having to support themselves. 

Even autocratic states in Africa during the 1950s and 60s were politically sovereign. Today they are controlled by foreign armies, warlords, and development organizations. Western development experts are not interested in improving the state’s capacity. Funnily enough the article calls out RCTs as small scale experiments and basically a waste of time.

The poor are facing an ecological and demographic crisis-- climate change and ballooning populations in the poorest countries. 

The solution will require new development minded elites to displace the extractive forces. Land and agriculture reform and rebuild state capacity. Stop outsourcing governance to foreign institutions, reimpose a monopoly on violence, mass health and education for the labor force like in China. Industrial policies and maybe new resource cartels like nickel in Indonesia. Withdrawing from global institutions and emulating modernizers like Ataturk and Xiaoping. 

Other imbalances must be fixed. Industrial production in the US and consumption in China. A return to Bretton Woods with regulations on capita flows would let countries develop autonomously and end the boom and bust cycles. WTO policies that prevent industrial policies that worked for industrializers in the past will have to end.
