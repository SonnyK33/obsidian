The ability to develop philosophy required basic needs to be met. You can’t be spending too much brain power on defense and food. From the early days, Western philosophy split into Greek and Italian schools  

Thales was considered the first philosopher. He tried to rationalize the world and realized that  crop performance was tied to rainfall. The pre-Socratics we’re focused on metaphysics whereas Socrates was focused on epistemology. He believed that everything was made of water. This was an example of Moneism - the belief that everything is composed of one substance. Along with his students, he formed the Mylesian school of thought.  

Hereclytus believed that everything is in a state of flux, and so you can never know what something’s true nature is. He coined the phrase - " You can’t step in the same river twice". He believed opposites - hot and cold for example - are the same thing just extremes on a spectrum. You can only understand one extreme if you have experienced the other. He believed a cosmic law governed everything. This reminded me of Camus in Sisyphus. He said that absurdisms can only be appreciated if you're comparing them to something else.

Democratus was the first to believe in atoms and voids. Atoms solved Xenos Paradox (To run 100m, you have to first run 50, and then 25, etc. Thus there are an infinite number of steps to run any distance. An indivisible atom solved this problem). It also reconciled the thought that something can’t come from nothing. Atoms just get reconfigured. This thought angered Christians.

Democratus was a rationalist who used reason and first principles over his senses (which allowed him to believe in atoms despite not being able to see them). 

**Italian Pre-Socratics**
Pythagorus ran a cult in a commune. He believed numbers govern everything and observed ratios in music. He was excited by discovering mathematical principles and seeing them in different contexts. His group beleived man reincarnated into different species and they hence didn’t eat meat. They believed in the importance of truth and thought it was the best way for man to repent for his sins. They may have been influenced by orphism. 
 

Parmenides was the father of deductive reasoning (can compare with Socrates who's considered the father of inductive reasoning). He argued that something can’t come from nothing.  Based on this, the universe always existed and change is impossible. Our world as we see it is an illusion

Impedicles believed the world was made up  4 elements - earth, wind, fire, and water. Things could only change between these elements. He was also the first to describe something similar to natural selection.
