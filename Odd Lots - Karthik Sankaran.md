Regional displacement more likely than replacement for the dollar, for example the the euro in Eastern Europe. A country doesn't have to run deficits to be the center of the monetary system - the US earlier and the UK before that while on the gold standard. You do need to get your currency out the door - either through running trade deficits or getting others to issue in your currency.   

Argued in a thread that Brazil should issue in RMB as its economy is linked with China's. However, it's not clear if it should issue in offshore or onshore RMB. Offshore is more accessible but is much shallower. It's hard to hedge RMB interest rate risk (compared to Eurodollar market). JPY was once a contender for a rival reserve currency, but Japan didn’t want it because it would hurt its industrial base. If China built a social safety net people could reduce savings which would cut the trade surplus. Due to excess preventive savings, local govt are underfunded and have to raise money by selling property to developers. So lower savings may prevent this and help with stability.  

The US is more FX sensitive than interest rate sensitive. Dollar centrality doesn’t always lead to a strong dollar. In 2002-2008 the US had its largest current account deficit - 6pct - and no one wanted to hold dollars. People want dollars when rates are rising like with the shale boom or tech boom in late 90s.

BRI lending in RMB would be easiest way to start the process of internationalizing the RMB. Countries with reserves above precautionary leveled can do different things with it. China used it for BRI lending, and the GCC is using it for Egypt and Turkey. One benefit of dollar centrality for the US is depreciation has limited pass through. More multipolarity may mean less procyclicality and more stability for the world.
