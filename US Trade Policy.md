[[A Monetary and Fiscal History of the US 1961-2021]]

If trade was running per fundamentals, the US would be running a trade surplus. In normal times, capital flows from rich countries with an abundance of technology and developed financial markets to less developed countries who need capital. The US should have a high savings rate, partially exacerbated to high levels of income inequality (the rich can save more). A high savings rate would  mean a lower consumption share and hence less imports. Savings (income that isn't consumed) that aren't invested must be exported as capital account deficits. That is, they're converted into foreign currencies and sent abroad. Because you would expect the US to have a higher savings rate than developing countries, there should be less demand to hold USD versus foreign currencies. USD instead would be spent on US exports, thus leading to a trade surplus. Capital flows means the US should run a capital account deficit and consequently a trade surplus. 

Shifts in income distribution affect the savings rate and the investment rate. Investment, along with the capital account, affects ex-post savings (the actual savings rate vs the ex-ante savings - what households plan to save). Any savings that aren't invested must be exported. Exported capital will pay for imports. So the excess savings translates to a current account surplus and a current account deficit. 

In rich countries, high savings won't fully translate to higher investment as investment needs are limited. In poor countries, when infrastructure needs are great, higher savings (and equivalently, lower consumption) should translate to higher investment. Excess savings (S - I) leads to a current account surplus and capital account deficit. Higher savings means less consumption and hence less imports. Excess savings in one region are used to purchase financial assets in another. That is, they're used to import financial assets and leads to a capital account deficit. For example, when excess Chinese savings are used to purchase US treasuries that creates a capital market deficit (DR or "import"). 

In the US, income inequality drives a higher savings rate and for savings to rise faster than investment. One would expect this to lead to a capital account deficit and current account surplus. This doesn't happen in the US, as its capital account is largely driven by the decision of foreigners. Currently, 40-50% of foreign capital account deficits (i.e. excess savings) is absorbed by the US. As long as there is so much foreign demand for USD, the US can't be a net exporter of savings. This also implies that the US doesn't actually have excess savings (since this is an accounting identity). So something is causing a savings deficit in other parts of the country. This is offsetting the excess savings created by income equality and all of the imported foreign savings. 

The chronic US trade deficit requires it to either accept higher unemployment or more debt (check companion pieces for explanation). The only way for the US to correct these imbalances is to manage its capital account (e.g. by taxing capital inflows). This is also an issue for other countries with open capital accounts (e.g. UK) and peripheral Europe which took in excess savings from Germany. Per [[Volatility Machine - WIP]] by the same author, capital flows into EM's during boom times also drive current account deficits in those countries. 



**Savings Rate**
This is a function of income distribution. As income shifts to richer or older households, savings should increase, and consumption should decrease. All income is by definition either saved or consumed. Businesses don't consume and save all of their income, which is either invested or distributed to shareholders. 

**GDP Accounting Identities**
GDP = Savings + Consumption
GDP = Consumption  + Investment + Capital Account Surplus
Consumption + Savings = Consumption + Investment + CA Surplus

Since CA balance = -Current Account Balance

Savings = Investment + (-Current Account Deficit)
Current Account Deficit =  Investment - Savings

**Current Account vs Capital Account Example**
An export leads to a credit entry on the current account, as an item is flowing out of the country. It leads to an equivalent debit on the capital ccount, as it's importing the currency to purchase the item. A current account deficit neccessitates a capital account surplus, as the country would be exporting an equivalent amount of capital to finance the net imports. 


The US exports a car to Germany for $1000. Assume the EUR exchange rate is USD 1.1 per EUR.

1) The German importer converts EUR 909 into $1000

US Capital Account
CR $1,000 (dollars exported to Germany)
DR EUR 909 (Euros imported to US)

German Capital Account
CR EUR 909 
DR $1,000 

2) The German purchases the car for $1,000. He is exporting $1,000 and importing a car. The US is exporting a car and importing the $1,000.

US Current Account
CR $1,000 (car)

**Reserve Currency and BoP**
Having the reserve currency means you run constant capital account surpluses. That is, you are constantly selling your currency to others (since it's the reserve currency). When other countries sell their goods to you (i.e. you imports), they earn your currency (you can also think about it you being  forced to convert your currency into theirs - either way, they'll earn your currency). As it's the reserve currency, other countries will hold that currency as savings. If it wasn't the reserve currency, they would instead spend it on your countries' exports, hence lowering the trade deficit. Rather than spending it on your exports though, they hold it in your securities. Hence, your reserve status leads to structural trade deficits. Either countries want your goods (or services) or your currency. When the US earns foreign currency, it spends it on imports, as they have no need to hold it as savings. 

While it's true that trade deficits lead to capital surpluses, it's wrong to think (as many argue) that trade deficits don't matter. Different goups will win or lose depending on whether you're exporting your currency or your goods. The rich will benefit from the ability to borrow at lower rates. The poor will lose from having a weaker export sector. 

**Savings Rate and Current Account Deficit**
The US runs a large current account deficit and hence a large capital account surplus. The current accound deficit is equivalent to running a savings deficit (investment > savings). Economists have proposed vairous ways for shrinking the trade deficit. In most small EMs, the trade deficit causes the capital account surplus. For example, Egypt's large current account deficit is caused by expensive energy and food imports. They have to finance that gap by borrowing from foreigners (which creates the capital account surplus). Cutting the current account deficit requires increasing the savings rate and consuming less. This can and will be accomplished by fiscal contractions. Pettis argues that the US is in a very different scenario. The US' current account deficit is caused by foreigners parking excess sacvings in treasuries (generating the capital account surplus). Because foreingers use dollars to buy treasuries rather than exports, the US has a trade deficit and capital account surplus. Pettis argues that attempts to increase the savings rate in the US will fail because the capital account is determined by foreigners and will force a current account deficit. In a world where your capital account is fixed in a surplus, forcing higher savings (through cutting fiscal spending or decreasing taxes on the rich or other regressive policies), there are two scenarios, given the above identity (S = I + Capital Account Surplus):
1) If the economy is starved for investment (like most EM's), savings and investment will rise by the same amount (remember - the capital account stays flat). This is the desired outcome of policymakers. The idea is that income will shift to those with a higher propensity to save (i.e. the rich, and not the government) who will invest the excess savings. 
2) If the economy is not starved for investment (like most developed countries, where the cost of capital has been very low), an increase in savings will be offset by a decrease somewhere else. The fiscal contraction will either raise unemployment (which lowers household savings) or increases debt (at the government level to subsidize the unemployed or at the household level by lowering interest rates).

Globally, savings must equal investment. If, in the US, investment exceeds savings, the reverse must be true for the rest of the world. Many economists in the US argue that if the savings rate could be increased, say by cutting the fiscal deficit, that would cause the current account deficit to decrease. That assumes however that savings and investment rates are independently formed. That is, households, firms, and the government determine their ideal savings rate, and the investment rate is determined by interest rates and aggregate demand. If domestic agents determine the US savings and investment rates that means they also determine the foreign investment and savings rate (since one determines the other). The bulk of global excess savings come from Germany, Japan, and China. So the question is if those countries have specific policies that led to their excess savings (and a lower distribution of income to households) and hence the US' savings deficit or the opposite. Pettis argues the former which requires only two assumptions:
1) The US capital account is completely open to foreigners
2) The US market is deep and liquid enough to accomodate all foreign excess savings
Both of these are true. 

Today the US' current and capital accounts are the residual shock absorbers for the rest fo the world. Foreigners purchase treasuries to hold their savings, not to finance US trade. In the 19th century, the US also ran a trade deficit, but that that time, most capital inflows were trade finance and were used specifically to finance the current account deficit. 

The impact of cutting the fiscal deficit also depends on whether there is demand for more investment.

This is true in developing countries (see above), but not in the US where one can borrow at very low rate. In a world where the capital account (and hence current account) is determined by foreign savings, there are two outcomes:

Key equation: Trade deficit = investment - savings
trade deficit = investment - (HH savings + corp savings - fiscal deficit)

1) if there is excess demand for investment, investment will rise by the amount of the fiscal deficit (trade deficit unchanged)
2) if there is no excess demand, savings will fall by the amount of the fiscal deficiit (trade deficit unchanged)
