Democracy vs foreign influence
[[The Humbling of Xi]]
One of the many weaknesses of a non-democratic country is the slowness in responding to a changing public. China may not be responding to a public getting more and more agitated with restrictive policies. They may incorrectly assume all of the protests are being organized by the West. in [[To Live]], we saw how beurocratic and authoritarian forces sometimes carry out policies indifferent to how they affect the average person. I could see another chapter in the book, where the main character is locked in at home and hears about a relative dying in a building fire. Even if the policies are well-meaning, it is hard to foresee how they will impact individuals. 

As it turns out, Xi did respond to public protests by opening up. Western press was very negative regarding covid zero and is similarly negative on the reopening. It's clear that government did respond to the will of the people, albeit later than many likely hoped.

China reopening
May be at peak infections in China but deaths normally peak 2 wks after so havenâ€™t seen peak hospitalizations yet (as of 1.5.23)

**Industrial policy**
China will make it easier for companies in hard sciences to list and harder for others (e.g fashion, consumer electronics). Companies must support national objective not just earn profits.
