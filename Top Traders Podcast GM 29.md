Geopolitics will become important in developed markets again due to de-globalization. For example, the Chip Act codifies the competition between China and the US over chips and goes against the spirit of the WTO which has been the case except for last 40 years. The EM toolkit will increasingly be important for analyzing developed markets.  

**Constraint based Analysis**

Covid zero is coming to an end because provinces are running out of money for testing and are asking ppl to pay for their own quarantine - not sustainable. China had also been reliant on external demand and the western binge on goods in 2021 allowed for the lock down - that’s over now.

Need to focus on material constrains of policymakers not their preferences. They have an inherent bias towards own country and will never admit their constraints. Don't try to predict political outcomes but instead focus on what’s priced in - just like with financial forecasting. Strive to be a-national when most analysts have latent biases. 

**Predictions**

Latin America will outperform due to commodity prices despite left leaning politics 

EMs may have more power than in the prev Cold War and will be bribed not invaded by major powers. Not sure I agree with this.

Dollar will diminish over time but stay first along equals for some time. 

Duro is biggest beneficiary as RMB not ready yet 
YCC for Italian yields means those are all Eurobonds de facto 

Swiss franc bonds will also become more attractive but exports are a major part of economy (as big as Germany as a pct) and so they don’t want massive appreciation 
 
As Ukrainian war becomes less popular in Russia, will enter stasis and interest will fade. This is similar to Ferguson's argument. 

Will hurt Eastern European economies (eg Poland and Romania) if they move closer to US vs EU in name of national security. Germany and France are key to their economic success not the US
