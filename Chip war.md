Reminds me of the Washington naval treaties in the 1930s that sought to freeze japans naval capacity. The sanctions on China require the cooperation of allies (Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Netherlands, etc.) as well as the private sector. It's hard to lose the Chinese market. Was that an issue enforcing the blockade against Japan as well? I think it was; allied trading with Japan until the end. [[Geopolitical Alpha]]

Did the blockade strengthen Japan by forcing it to develop technologies in-house? That's happening with China.

AAPL and TSLA most at risk from new china paradigm
The cost of aapl chips is higher than what's reflected in prices and they can't pass on prices to consumers in current environment. The main takeaway for chip war is more inflation for everyone and that high tech disinflation narrative is over.



The US is seeking to keep China more and more behind in its ability to produce the most high end silicone chips; that is, it wishes for the gap to grow as technology in the West improves. This is an escalation from Trump who sought to freeze the gap at 2 generations. Biden now wants to freeze China at current levels  

The main implication is inflation for consumers and businesses. If China can’t access the equipment to make chips it won’t be able to supply cheap chips to the West. While bans will freeze China from the most advanced uses, China could retaliate by not providing the cheaper less advanced chips - which are used everywhere (autos, iPhones etc).

There's an example right now - the lastest work stoppages at Foxconn plant threaten iphone 14 pro deliveries by Xmas.

Currently only Taiwan and South Korea can produce the most advanced chips. The US is incentivizing global chip producers to build plants in the U.S. (e.g. TSM's new plant in AZ). However per their last earnings call, the construction cost of buildings and facilities are 4-5x higher in the US for a fab versus in Taiwan. 

  
Part of the US' strategy in containing China's chip capabilities is strengthening client states, particularly South Korea and Europe. Europe’s  comparative advantage in chip making is manufacturing some of the key equipment needed to manufacture semiconductors, especially the cutting edge ones. It also has strengths in chemicals and materials. It’s lacking in advanced chip design and in finding skilled staff. It’s relying on immigration to fill the gap.  Will likely need more state support for large scale capex.  See: [[Europe - Outline]]
