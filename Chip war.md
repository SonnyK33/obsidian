AAPL and TSLA most at risk from new china paradigm
The cost of aapl chips is higher than what's reflected in prices and they can't pass on prices to consumers in current environment. The main takeaway for chip war is more inflation for everyone and that high tech disinflation narrative is over.

Follow-ups:
Reminds me of the Washington naval treaties in the 1930s that sought to freeze japans naval capacity


The US is seeking to keep China more and more behind in its ability to produce the most high end silicone chips; that is, it wishes for the gap to grow as technology in the West improves. This is an escalation from Trump who sought to freeze the gap at 2 generations. Biden now wants to freeze China at current levels  

The main implication is inflation for consumers and businesses. If China can’t access the equipment to make chips it won’t be able to supply cheap chips to the West. While bans will freeze China from the most advanced uses, China could retaliate by not providing the cheaper less advanced chips - which are used everywhere (autos, iPhones etc).

There's an example right now - the lastest work stoppages at Foxconn plant threaten iphone 14 pro deliveries by Xmas.

Currently only Taiwan and South Korea can produce the most advanced chips.
