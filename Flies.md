Takeaways:
1) To lead the people, you must share their guilt for past crimes
2) Leaders often use scare tactics to force people into submission and into a state of fear. This also comes from collective guilt over past crimes, and the feeling of vulnerability. This reminded me of [[War of the Worlds]] and the allegory for Victorian England, as well as Americans' fear of crime and foreign nations. 
3) The link with existentialism is that Orestes defies convention (as represented by Zeus) and does what feels right. He has free will and can do what he wants. It also shows the limits of free will though; they can't take back what they've done. The people also have the ability to stop mourning Agamemnon, but they don't


This is Satre’s take on the Electra myth. It's the story of Electra and her brother Orestes avenging the murder of their father, Agamemnon. It’s an existential take and will show Orestes rise to the occasion. It contrasts with Zeus’ orthodoxy and advice for letting things just be.

Zeus warns Orestes not to return. As he wasn’t part of the crime (i.e. the murder of his father) he has no understanding of their remorse and won’t be able to relate to them. Orestes later agrees that a king should share his people’s memories. I thought that was interesting and not conventional advice. Many would say a leader should be objective and rise above past conflicts. Zeus says the people have a guilty conscience but that can quickly change and their sins can harden on them. Interesting read through for present times.

Electra tells Orestes that she’s being mistreated by Clytemnestra and that the whole town has a guilty conscience. It’s clear that she’s waiting for her brother to return and Clytemnestra is fearing his return. Electra clearly hates and resents her mother as well as her stepfather. Clytemnestra seems to regret her treachery but also warns Electra about youthful pride. 

There’s an annual festival when the town pretends ghosts from the past come back to the city. The town is in constant mourning and is never allowed to be happy. The king has convinced the people to be sorry they’re alive versus all of those who died. Electra defies the king and criticizes the display saying it doesn’t honor the dead. She tells the crowds that people elsewhere are happy, which angers the king and his pious followers. She asks the ghosts of her father and sister to make a sign if her dancing offends them, which they don’t.

Orestes tries to bring Electra back with him after revealing his identity. Electra is initially angry that he’s not willing to fight for the throne. After asking for a signal from Zeus, Orestes abandons his youthful innocence and says he will take on the town’s guilt and fight the king.

Zeus warns the king about Electra and Orestes’ plan. It seems that Zeus orchestrated the killing of Agamemnon in order to get the whole city in permanent remorse. He also tells the king he’s unable to stop Orestes as he’s free and god can’t stop free will. Orestes kills the king and Clytemnestra, but it’s clear they’re no longer free as they can’t take back what they did. Orestes doesn’t care that Zeus was against him taking revenge. Not sure what the flies represent. The power has gone to Orestes’ head. 

The king made up the legend of the dead rising to keep the people fearful. The flies disfigure Electra while she’s sleeping and when she wakes up she regrets the whole thing. She blames Orestes for everything. Zeus condemns them both. Orestes argues that he’s free as is Electra and that’s all that matters. He tells the people that their sins are now his.
