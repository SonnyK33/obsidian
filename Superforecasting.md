Tetlock argues that anyone can improve their ability to forecast events, even, and especially, non-subject experts. He uses the fox and hedgehog metaphor to describe the two ways of building expertise. Foxes attempt to know a little about a lot of things and connect dots. They're humble about what they don't know and are able to abstract from specific issues to broader lessons. Hedgehogs, conversely, have one big idea and fit everything into that mold. They're subject experts, which often makes them arrogant and inflexible to new information. 

Becoming a fox requires practice with forecasting. You need to conduct assessments of why you were wrong or right about previous forecasts. Specificity, to the extent possible, is also important. Vague assertions only shield the predictor from criticism when he's wrong. Abstracting, or taking the outside view, is an important step. Even obscure events can be related to ones that already occurred. 

Chapter 1 An Optimistic Skeptic
Chapter 2 Illusions of Knowledge

We operate with two systems of cognition. System 1 is intuition, and system 2 is conscious thinking. System 1 allows for snap judgements. Accurate predictions require a plan and reassessments; they require system 2 thinking. Subject matter experts (hedgehogs) rely on system 1 thinking. 

Medicine for a long time was driven by intuition

We justify what our system

1 initially perceives -

Confirmation bias

Attribution bias -

If too complex to figure out, simplify question

Need to know when to go with system 1 and when to doubt it. It can detect subtle patterns that you’ve observed over time and extrapolate. The question is if the information required to use system 1 likely exists or not. If it’s unlikely to be available, should be skeptical of snap judgements.

Quantify probabilities.

Forces you to calibrate judgements and think about how you’re estimating. Prevents truisms.like something may happen

When you place odds on something should lose commensurately if wrong 

  

Big idea ppl are driven by ideology and try to fit to their worldview - hedgehogs

Foxes know about a lot of

Stuff

And admit when wrong, state probabilities

From Isaiah Berlin essay 

Kudlow a hedgehog who fits everything into supply side ideology

Hedgehogs are Simplisitc w easy answers. This makes them pleasing to audiences and they hence become more popular than foxes and who have nuance.

H’s one big idea makes them confident and more palatable.

  

Aggregating experts can be useful. Errors in guesses will cancel our and useful adjustments they make will add up. Works if ppl are making smart estimates.

Beat IARPA by aggregating the crowds, taking the top performers and then extrmizing their forecasts ie 70pct to 85 and 30 to 10 to simulate confidence 

Top performers based on previous observations of accuracy 

  

Regression to the mean is powerful and forgotten often

Thinks we attribute to skill are often just luck and mean reversion ie everyone right eventually, you’ll likely feel better even without medication so shouldn’t always attribute to treatment, etc

  

Even among super forecasters, only 70pct remained accurate the next period 

Much better than random guessers and showing less mean reversion but still not infallible 

  

Chap 5

Super forecasters are smarter than average but not geniuses 

Point of diminishing returns and curiosity and awareness are more important and genius level IQ

Wonder if geniuses actually do worse bc overconfident 

  

Break down questions into constituent parts and easier questions 

Like consulting market sizing

What do you need to know

What would need to be true for x to be true 

How many piano tutors In Chicago

Population in Chicago, how many own pianos, how often does one need tuning etc

Key is to understand what’s knowable and what isn’t 

These back of envelope answers Tends to be accurate even without outside info

Start with the outside view 

This is the general case abstracted from the details 

Eg trying to forecast a border dispute first assess

How often those occur 

This gives a base rate which you can then adjust 

If start w inside view risk of anchoring bias

For inside view

Start with hypotheses 

For each, what would need to be true for it to be true 

Doesn’t help to just immerse yourself in general information 

For each question, try considering the opposite question to prevent anchoring

Write down your prediction and thought process 

Come back to it a few days later 

Would you still agree 

  

Active open minded - seek other views

Numeracy important but advanced quant techniques not

Attempt to be more granular in probability forecasts

Super forecasters don’t have false precision - the more precise they are the more accurate they tend to be 

Rounding off their prob estimates takes away the accuracy quickly 

Make forecast more precise in stages 

  

Don’t think of things as inevitable. If you think something was meant to be just because it was unlikely (like falling in love w someone) that means you think the prob was 100pct which is contradictory 

Take it as evidence of how uncertain the future is 

Instead of why think about how - how did something happen 

Like slaughter house - why me? Why not me?

And Aurelius - understand the process 

Don’t worry about why 

Believing in fate is reassuring but hurts forecast

Remember to think about outside view and not get lost in emotional details - that’s what leads to fatalistic thinking

  

Chap 7 - news

Process - break all questions into small ones

Separate known from unknown 

Test all assumptions 

Take outside view - where have you seen similar questions before - this is a specific case of a general case

Then inside view - what’s unique here

Compare your views w others - what’s market pricing 

Extract wisdom from crowd

Synthesize views as specifically as possible using probabilities 

Make note of metrics you need to follow to change mind and prob 

Pay attention of those metrics and update often 

Preparation is key here as is recording the metrics and timelines 

Collect major questions into categories and see what the common metrics are

Need to update forecasts w new info 

Can be hard to adjust prior views

Often hard to change beliefs bc they’re deeply held and may tie w your identity

Changing them crashes everything else you believe

Can be a weakness for subject matter experts as their forecasts become sacred and hard to admit you’re wrong 

Another way of saying should have conviction but should be loosely held and willing to change w new info 

Don’t make them your identity

Have an advantage making predictions over things you don’t care about 

  

May also be guilty of overreacting to irrelevant information. Need to filter that out. Helps by thinking of key questions and metrics ahead of time.

SF update often but they make small changes

Chap 8

Growth mindset is key

Always be practicing 

You can learn anything and get better w practice 

Don’t rely on endowments

Need to be objective and not lured by praise

Be self critical

Always be improving and looking to learn. Assume you have much to learn and improve.

  

Chap 8

Groups can be powerful via aggregation and canceling out one’s errors

But can also lead to complacency and groupthink

Unanimanity taken as meaning certainty

Teams normally outperform individuals 

As they have different styles and can do more research 

Requires members to challenge each other and be critical without offending 

That requires mutual trust

Diverse teams are good if they can Each contribute something . That’s logic of extremising results. In bid laden example, many members knew stuff others didn’t.

ExtrmiIng would’ve compensated for this and produced an average forecast in the 90s. A team w no diversity where the very one knows the same thing Shouldn’t be extemized.

  

Chap 10

Motler- German general - come up with plans but let those on the ground execute. Acknowledges that no plan survives encounter w enemy so must be flexible and open to new info 

  

But when a plan is decided must act

Be confident esp vs enemies but intellectually humble ie open to idea that you could be wrong 

  

Milton - paradise lost - devil is evil but also resourceful 

Don’t sacrifice facts for morality. That is you can learn from those you disagree with eg the competence of the German army despite their evil goals

I’d add that often moral judgements themselves are hypocritical and inconsistent - you should test those as well 

If you follow Aurelius - morality and fact based judgement should be one in the same though former should flow from latter not the reverse 

  

Many forecasters esp those in charge are guilty of this error eg underestimating Russian or Syrian armies

Chap 11

Scope sensitivity 

How would your forecast change if the question was a little different eg a longer timeframe for something to happen

Again helps to start w outside view to get base case

Even w good forecasts have to be wary of black swans

All forecast should be tentative 

Strive for anti fragility 

Know when you’d change your mind

There are many alternative futures 

Fat tails per taleb

Remember that when forecasting 

  

Chap 12

Forecasts often have an agenda 

They seek to promote the forecasters interests

We care about the big questions but easier to score the simpler binary questions 

Key is to break down big important question into these smaller ones which are cumulative and form the logical catalyst path

Hedgehogs may be better at asking questions 

They’re big picture and have 1 big idea 

Can think thematically

Whereas foxes are good at answering 

They may be too in the weeds to

Think of best questions 

So need bit of

Both

Appendix

Guidelines

1) triage - answer questions where work will pay off

Not impossible ones or easy ones that can be approximated 

  

2) break he’d questions into easier ones 

Separate into knowable and unknowable 

Fermize - market sizing technique 

Often accurate

  

3) start w outside view

Where have you seen something similar 

When you have baseline switch to inside 

  

4)
Right.m balance of over and under reacting to new info 

Incrementally update when new info 

Be open to changing mind if x happens 

  

5

Understand the causal forces that lead to opposing views

Thesis plus antithesis gets synthesis

To form a coherent dragonfly view need to understand opposing arguments 

List in advance what would change your mind 

Doves should know when they’d become hawks 

  

6

Separate into degrees of uncertainty 

As much as possible but no more

Helps to quantify w as much gradiation as possible 

Avoid vague phrases

  

7

Be humble about changing 

Mind and getting better but also need to be decisive

And confident 

  

8

Fix past mistakes but avoid rear view bias

Do post Mortema on correct predictions as well as might’ve gotten lucky

  

9

Team management 

Understand team mates opinions 

  

10
Need to practice 

  

11

No rules are firm
