Tetlock argues that anyone can improve their ability to forecast events, even, and especially, non-subject experts. He uses the fox and hedgehog metaphor to describe the two ways of building expertise. Foxes attempt to know a little about a lot of things and connect dots. They're humble about what they don't know and are able to abstract from specific issues to broader lessons. Hedgehogs, conversely, have one big idea and fit everything into that mold. They're subject matter experts, which often makes them arrogant and inflexible to new information. 

Becoming a fox requires practice with forecasting. You need to conduct assessments of why you were wrong or right about previous forecasts. Specificity, to the extent possible, is also important. Vague assertions only shield the predictor from criticism when he's wrong. Abstracting, or taking the outside view, is an important step. Even obscure events can be related to ones that already occurred. 

A key insight in the book is that you need to know when to rely on intuition and when not to. If the information required to use system 1 thinking (intuition) is available, then this mode may be sufficient. This requires humility of what you don't know. 

Steps to effective forecasting:

1) Triage - answer questions where the work will pay off. Don't focus on impossible ones or easy ones that can be approximated. This means keep the timeframe reasonable. 

2) Break hard questions into easier ones and separate them into knowable and unknowable pieces. Remember "Fermi-ization", the market sizing technique, which is often reasonably accurate. This may be the most important part. 
	1) For example - will COMM's EBITDA increase in H2'24?
		1) Will its revenue increase?
		2) Which segments are most important?
			1) In those segments, will it sell more items?
				1) Will its customer purchase more items?
					1) Who are their customers?
						1) What have they said about capex?
						2) Can they spend more?
		3) Repeat for other segments
		4) Will its costs increase?
			1) what are fixed versus variable costs?
				1) Are fixed costs likely to change?

4) Start with the outside view, and think about where have you seen something similar. When you've established the baseline, switch to the inside view. For my purposes, this is why it's important to separate trades into types. All liquidity-constrained trades have similarities. Likewise for recovery trades. For the COMM example, when was the last time Telco/cable companies cut capex? How long does it take for suppliers to recover? Energy suppliers in 2021 could be a good comparable.

5) Maintain a balance balance between over and under reacting to new information. Incrementally update when you receive new information and be open to changing your mind if something happens. It's important to identify what information you're waiting for. Capex budgets, leverage of customers, etc. 
 
6) Understand the causal forces that lead to opposing views. Your thesis plus the antithesis gets you a synthesis. To form a coherent "dragonfly" view, you need to understand opposing arguments. List in advance what would change your mind. Even doves should know when they’d become hawks. If your answer is never, your predictions are becoming too close to your identity. You need to avoid that. Come up with the opposite thesis for all trades. Why would someone do the opposite?

7) Separate your predictions into degrees of uncertainty. Be as specific as possible but no more. It helps to quantify with as much gradiation as possible and to avoid vague phrases. Come up with a %, and compare with what the market price is implying. 

8) Be humble about changing your mind, but you also need to be decisive and confident. This is easier when you identify the metrics in advance.

9) Fix past mistakes but avoid rear view bias. Do post mortems on correct predictions as well as ones where you might’ve gotten lucky. Review trades when they're closed. 

10) To manage effective teams, understand your team mates' opinions.

11) Practice making forecasts and see where you went wrong.



Chapter 1 An Optimistic Skeptic
Chapter 2 Illusions of Knowledge

We operate with two systems of cognition. System 1 is intuition, and system 2 is conscious thinking. System 1 allows for snap judgements. Accurate predictions require a plan and reassessments; they require system 2 thinking. Subject matter experts (hedgehogs) rely on system 1 thinking. Medicine for a long time was driven by intuition.

We justify what our system 1 initially perceives; this is confirmation bias. Attribution bias is when we over-simplify a questions, and answer a different one instead. You need to know when to go with system 1 and when to doubt it. It can detect subtle patterns that you’ve observed over time and extrapolate. The question is if the information required to use system 1 likely exists or not. **If it’s unlikely to be available, you should be skeptical of snap judgements.** 

Chapter 3 Keeping Score

Quantifying probabilities and forecasts keeps you honest. It forces you to calibrate judgements and think about how you’re estimating. It prevents truisms like saying something may happen. When you place odds on something, you should lose commensurately if wrong. Making small bets like this sharpens your ability to calibrate your level of conviction. 


Chapter 4 Superforecasters


Big idea people (hedgehogs) are driven by ideology and try to fit what they observe to their worldview. Foxes, conversely, know a little about a lot of things. They admit when they're wrong and use probabilities to communicate their confidence and to keep them honest. He's referencing the Isaiah Berlin essay. He gives the example of Larry Kudlow, as a hedgehog who fits everything into his supply side ideology. Hedgehogs are simplistic and have lots of easy answers. This makes them pleasing to audiences, and they hence become more popular than foxes and who have nuance. Hedgehogs' one big idea make them confident and more palatable. 

Aggregating experts can be useful. Errors in guesses will cancel out, and the useful adjustments they make will add up. This only works if people are making smart estimates. The super-forecasters beat IARPA by aggregating the crowds, taking the top performers, and then extremizing their forecasts. For instance, 70pct was turned into 85 and 30 became 10 to simulate confidence. Top performers were selected based on previous observations of accuracy.  

Regression to the mean is powerful and forgotten often. Many things we attribute to skill are often just luck and mean reversion. Everyone is right eventually, and you’ll likely feel better even without medication. We shouldn’t always attribute effects to specific stimuli. Even among super forecasters, only 70pct remained accurate in the next period. They were much better than random guessers, and showing less mean reversion, but they weren't not infallible 

Chapter 5 Supersmart?

Super forecasters are smarter than average but they aren't geniuses. The point of diminishing returns comes quickly, and curiosity and awareness are more important than genius level IQ. Geniuses may actually do worse because they're overconfident.

The key to solving complex problems is breaking down the questions into constituent parts and easier questions, like the market sizing consultants do. Break questions into knowable and unknowable. For the former, what do you need to know? What would need to be true for it to be true. 

For example, try answering how many piano tutors are there in Chicago. Start with the population in Chicago, then how many own pianos, and how often does one need tuning. The key is to understand what’s knowable and what isn’t. These back of envelope answers tends to be accurate even without outside info.

You start with the outside view; this is the general case abstracted from the details. For example if you're trying to forecast a border dispute, first assess how often those occur. This gives a base rate which you can then adjust. If you're starting with an inside view, there's risk of anchoring bias.

Then move to the inside view. Start with hypotheses, and for each, determine what would need to be true for it to be true. It doesn’t help to just immerse yourself in general information. For each question, try considering the opposite question to prevent anchoring. Write down your prediction and thought process. Come back to it a few days later. Do you still agree? Be actively open minded and seek other views.

Chapter 6 Superquants?

Numeracy is important but advanced quant techniques are not. Strive to be more granular in probability forecasts. Super forecasters don’t have false precision; the more precise they are the more accurate they tend to be. Rounding off their prob estimates takes away the accuracy quickly. Try making forecasts more precise in stages.  

Don’t think of things as inevitable. If you think something was meant to be just because it was unlikely to happen (like falling in love with someone) that means you think the probability was 100pct which is contradictory. Instead, take it as evidence of how uncertain the future is. Instead of the "why", think about the "how". Like in [[Slaughterhouse Five]], - why me? Why not me? Aurelius in [[Meditations]] also talks about this. Understand the process, and don’t worry about the why. Believing in fate is reassuring but it hurts forecasts. Remember to think about the outside view and to not get lost in emotional details - that’s what leads to fatalistic thinking

Chapter 7 Super news junkies?

The above process, breaking all questions into small ones, and separating known from unknown questions is much more useful than immersing yourself in information. Test all assumptions and take the outside view. Where have you seen similar questions before? This is a specific case of a general case. Then take the inside view and assess what’s unique here.

Compare your views with others and determine what the market is pricing in. This way you can extract wisdom from crowds. You can synthesize views as specifically as possible using probabilities. Make note of metrics you need to follow to change your mind and the forecasted probabilities. Pay attention to those metrics and update them often. Preparation is key here, as is recording the metrics and timelines. Collect major questions into categories and see what the common metrics are. You need to update forecasts with new information. It can be hard to adjust prior views, and it's often hard to change beliefs because they’re deeply held and may tie with your identity. It's important to not tie your forecasts and predictions with your values. Otherwise changing them challenges everything else you believe. This can be a weakness for subject matter experts as their forecasts become sacred, and it's hard to admit you’re wrong. Another way of saying this is you should have conviction, but it should be loosely held and you need to be willing to change it with new information. Have an advantage by making predictions over things you don’t care about. We can also be guilty of overreacting to irrelevant information. You can avoid this by thinking of key questions and metrics ahead of time. The best forecasters update often but generally rely on small changes.

Chapter 8 Perpetual Beta

A growth mindset is key. You can learn anything and get better with practice. Don’t rely on endowments. We need to be objective and not be lured by praise. Be self critical and always be improving and looking to learn. 

Chapter 9 Super teams

Groups can be powerful via aggregation and from canceling out individual errors, but they can also lead to complacency and groupthink. Unanimity can be taken as meaning certainty. Teams normally outperform individuals, as they have different styles and can do more research. This requires members to challenge each other and be critical without offending, which requires mutual trust. Diverse teams are good if they can each contribute something. That’s the logic of extremizing results. In the Bin Laden example, many members knew stuff that others didn’t. Extremizing would’ve compensated for this and produced an average forecast in the 90s. A team with no diversity where everyone knows the same thing shouldn’t be extremized.

Chapter 10 The Leader's Dilemma

Motler, a German general, came up with plans but let those on the ground execute. This acknowledges that no plan survives the encounter with the enemy so we must be flexible and open to new information. But when a plan is decided, we must act. Be confident especially vs enemies but be intellectually humble and open to the idea that you could be wrong. Milton, in paradise lost, said the devil is evil, but he's also resourceful. Don’t sacrifice facts for morality. That is, you can learn from those you disagree with, for example the competence of the German army despite their evil goals.

I’d add that often moral judgements themselves tend to be hypocritical and inconsistent. We should test our objectivity. Many forecasters, especially those in charge, are guilty of this error. For instance, they underestimate Russian or Syrian armies because they disagree with their goals. If you follow Aurelius, morality and fact based judgement should be one in the same, though the former should flow from the latter not the reverse. 


Chapter 11 Are They Really So Super?

How would your forecast change if the question was a little different? For example, if the timeframe for something to happen was extended. He calls this scope sensitivity. Again, it helps to start with the outside view to get a base case. 

Even with good forecasts, you have to be wary of black swans, and the unpredictable. All forecast should be tentative and know when you’d change your mind. There are many alternative futures, and the "impossible" happens frequently (fat tails per Taleb).

Chapter 12 What's Next?

Forecasts often have an agenda, as they seek to promote the forecaster's interests. 

We care about the big questions, but it's easier to score the simpler binary questions. The key is to break down big important question into these smaller ones which are cumulative and form the logical catalyst path. 

Hedgehogs may actually be better at asking questions, as they’re big picture thinkers and have one big idea. They can think thematically. Whereas foxes are good at answering those questions. They may be too in the weeds to think of the best questions. So you often need bit of both. Think thematically, but answer systematically.
