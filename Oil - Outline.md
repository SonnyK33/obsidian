**Commodity price**
- structural underinvestment may be coming to an end as valuations w/ growth investments start to converge
- new capex will at first be inflationary as it will take time for new supply to come online 
-  shock to rates have made it much more expensive to carry large inventories (physical and financial) and led to large destocking
	- explains why curve is backwardated
	- higher rates increase carrying costs and should lead to steeper curve, but the rate move has been a shock rather than a steady increase 
	- expect curve to normalize barring another shock (which could come)		
-  destocking -> scarcity risk -> increases commodity volatility and decreases liquidity -> lowers long-term price (backwardated curve) -> lowers capex -> constrains equity value -> keeps capex low etc


**Credit**
- deleveraging over as most credits are below their leverage targets


**Geopolitics** 
-   as Russian and other non-OPEC production falls further in 2023, US share and GCC are all that’s left
-   US shale has its own issues, leaving OPEC w/ more market power than it’s ever had before
-   Cap on Russian oil needs to be dynamic or else Russia is incentivized to use its shadow fleet and reduce overall supply ->I don’t think it’ll be easy to do this


**Shale**
- productivity is starting to decline (fits with idea that most tier 1 permian acreage is gone)
- that plus capex/opex inflation means lower capital efficiency 

**Trades**
- want to move towards longer-duration assets (international gas, oil sands, and offshore) and away from US shale
- also true for liquids focused midstreams that are dependent on shale production 
- shorts -
	- short-duration shale assets
		- Midstreams - #MMP #TRGP 
		- E&Ps - #MRO #DVN #EOG #PXD #FANG 
		- Supplier - #HAL
	- perps going into a pivot next year
		- #PAA - will get hit by falling front-end rates and higher long-end spreads (assuming #pivot in a recession)
- Longs - 
	- long-duration assets
		- Midstreams - #ET #WMB #ENBCN
		- E&Ps - #HESS #COP #AKERBP #CVECN
		- Supplier - #SLB
12.14.22
- sell oil puts - structurally higher oil will be accompanied by lower oil vol 
	- there's also an implicit put by OPEC who won't let prices fall below a certain level
