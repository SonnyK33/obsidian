During the Arab conquest people had to convert to Islam. There were three primary philosophical figures - Al-Fayad, Al-kindi, and Al-ruzali.

Ruzali rejected authority and sought to understand things by reason like Socrates. But he ended up in an infinite loop of skepticism. He escaped by concluding that some things can’t be reasoned. Just like your eyes can’t hear, your reasoning faculties can’t know everything. It’s one thing to understand the definition of something, but another to experience it, hence the limitations of reason. You can understand health without being healthy. For things that reason can’t explain, one should rely on the prophets.  

Averowies (sp?) - religion provides a simplified framework for the masses. It doesn’t make sense to question people’s faith because it provides order. Most people won’t be able to use reason anyways.
