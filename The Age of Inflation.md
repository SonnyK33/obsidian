The Fed was far too late in raising rates and drastically underestimated inflation risks for 2022. The causes were political -

1) post GFC, the Fed is much less independent and is focused on reducing inequality and preventing recessions which tend hurt the poorest segments of the population. If they started hiking in 2021 and caused a recession when a Covid variant came back, they wouldn’ve been heavily criticized and could’ve risked central bank independence. The 2008 crisis hurt the narrative that their policies helped all people - Many lost their jobs and homes. I don’t agree with this - people don’t blame the Fed for the GFC.

2) Powell may have been worried about getting reappointed and so didn’t turn hawkish until after his appointment was confirmed - Biden could’ve confirmed him earlier 

3) Biden and Trump pushed stimulus plans well after the worst of Covid

4) A push for MMT and MMT-lite policies which advocate for more spending to help the poorest segments of population, ignoring the difficulties in managing spending and cutting it before inflation steeps in

  

The resistance to use negative rates was also a mistake. If they had that ability, they may been willing to get hawkish sooner as they knew they wouldn’t be bound by zero rates. This would’ve required legal changes as well as policies to prevent people from moving from deposits to paper currencies to avoid negative rates. One solution would be digital currencies (India Is trying this) as well as free accounts for the underbanked (Japan provides this). Rogoff doesn’t explain why negative rates in Japan and Europe didn’t allow them to get hawkish sooner. He also claims that even without a digital currency or some kind of depreciating rate between bills and deposits, you could go up to -3pct by phasing out $50 and $100 bills.

  

Although Volker is remembered for taming inflation, he may have let it run hot in order to help Reagan win re-election. 

  

Inflation most likely won’t get back to prepandemic levels and central banks won’t have the stomach to induce a recession. The new policy framework expressly aims to help disadvantaged groups, exactly who would be hurt the most in a recession.

  

Raising the inflation target from 2pct could give more flexibility to cut rates in a crisis (a parallel to having negative rates. However it would cause a collapse in credibility. Higher long term inflation would also cause wages and prices to adjust more quickly - lowering the impact of monetary tightening. There would also be less room to cut in a recession. If real rates go back up to their pre GFC trend (falling 1.6 per century) - they fell 3 in 2009 - central banks will want to keep rates low to devalue debt.

  

  

The 2020s have a lot in common with the 1970s including the oil shocks - oil embargo then and Ukraine war now.
