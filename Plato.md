Plato was upset after Socrates’ trial which happened after the Pelopennesian war. He left and studied abroad. In his works he combines historical figures and imagines conversations between them. In the symposium, the characters tried to understand what love was through questioning each other. Socrates argues that it starts with the desire to reproduce and live forever. This is lust and is the first level. It goes to beauty and then personality and then for specific concepts. When you love concepts you’re more secure because they’ll never leave you, but they also don’t love you back. This is called this platonic love.

When you think about something long enough you’ll understand it’s essence. For example, the essence of a tree or justice. But you’ll only know it in its ideal form which doesn’t exist. The ideal forms live in the world of forms which is separate from the material world.  

**The Allegory of Caves**

We’re all chained in a cave and can only see the shadows of objects, not their true form. We can only see the latter if we break our chains and turn around. This is accomplished through reason and logic. This was the job of philosophy -  to see as many true forms as possible. Many modern day stories (e.g. the Matrix and taking a "red pill" come from this story). We’re all born with innate knowledge and the ability to see true forms. This is called innate knowledge. He demonstrated by using Socratic method on a kid, teaching him basic geometry. He was addressing the Sophists claims around relative knowledge. What do we know and how do we know it. Reason trumps the senses. This laid ground work for 17th century rationalism.

  

**Views on Government**

The rich moralize the poor and force standards on them while they wallow in their greed. These are the worst candidates to govern. Everyone should do what they’re best at. The masses should be taught with positive influences and not corrupted. The best form is an aristocracy ruled by a philosopher king. Democracy is the second worst, only better than a tyrant. An oligarchy where the rich rule over the poor is better than democracy but it isn’t stable and we'll devolve into the latter.
