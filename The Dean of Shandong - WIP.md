Bell uses his former position as the Dean of the political theory department at the University of Shandong to explain Chinese political thinking to Western audiences. As the US tries to isolate China and slow its growth by demonizing its political leadership and development model, this book attempts to explain the Chinese political system to Westerners. While it is sympathetic to the Chinese system of political meritocracy, It doesn't hesitate to criticize China and President Xi for growing censorship and the abandonment of term limits. Bell is a scholar of Confucianism and he puts contemporary Chinese political theory in the context of its ancient traditions. 


**Resurgence of Confucianism in China**

Reached its low point during cultural revolution but has now become the public face of the country. The philosophy has never been against economic modernization like many others have. China has once again become the academic center for Confucianism with many leading professors moving from the US. One academic published reports showing Chinese students more likely to use confusion dialects to solve problems -

What are examples of this

  

Promotes collective well being and morality but took backseat to specific poverty alleviation during rise of communism. Also focused on meritocracy 

  

Does this unite a large portion of Chinese population? 

  

Author became interested as related to communitarianism 

  

School he deans educates CCP members and cadres and is home for retired members. Important to government

Political agenda is to de-demonize ccp

Acknowledges risk in ending term limits for Xi and issues with Uigyurs, but no risk of China attacking the US while it is surrounded by US bases and so has much to fear

  

The ccp is popular even with Chinese abroad and those able to travel. That’s a function of the economic growth in the past 50 years and increases in living standards. Most ccp officials are trying to make things better for Chinese people.

  

White air has always been a sign of frailty and so political leaders always dye it black

  

Xi broke this norm maybe signifying fiat among equals 

He also led the popular anti corruption drive which previous leaders weren’t willing to do

But he may have taken his individual leadership vs rest of party too far 

  

Compares his ambition which required dying his hair to Rousseaus confessions

Government does a disservice w poor translations including ministry of propaganda 

But western governments consider all non electoral democracies as illegitimate and puts ccp in same category as NK or Saudi without caring about any differences or appreciating the historical legacies with meritocracy 

There have been tremendous changes despite one party rule

Author is being generous - US considers any government that opposes it as illegitimate including electoral democracies

Either topples them or brands them authoritarian 

It does appreciate the difference between it and NK which is why it fears it 

It’s worries that the Chinese way may work

Suchi system  - govt appointed bureaucrats who police faculty can be annoying as they do censor. But they can also be fair.

Highlights an episode where an anti communist former faculty leader wasn’t kicked out of WeChat group because they hadn’t kicked out other ex faculty members. Was eventually removed for disruptive comments but highlights there is some order

  

Deng sought to avoid the personality cult and established term limits while he still exercised control when retired

  

Administrative positions are prestigious even though they pay less. This is an ancient tradition where leadership was through meritocracy except for the emperor. In shangdong 7 is the lucky number bc of phrase 57 up, 58 down meaning up or out at 57

Collective leadership may be a good thing but certain conditions necessary 

Needs to be a first among equals who has moral and formal authority

Dissent should be allowed and encouraged 

  

Emperors in China we’re absolute rulers but decisions were recorded for posterity which was a partial check 

  

Corruption - use of public funds for private use is the worst thing a Confucian leader can do

Cited as a contributor to fall of Ming and chin dynasties

As well as ccp victory over kmt who were able to appeal to the people 

  

Mao wasn’t guilty of corruption for money but was drunk with power

People died because of persecution and poor policies

  

After Deng opened up economy, many officials starting looking for their cut 

Corruption became rampant reaching a tipping point in 2012 when Xi took over

Polls showed corruption was the public’s number 1 issue w the system eg getting into good universities perceived as unfair

His predecessors half heartedly went after corruption 

They recognized it as a threat to ccp rule though 

  

Xi punished 1m officials including a dozen high ranking military officials 

The west portrays this as going after his enemies, but he made many enemies by going after so many people and disturbing practices

  

People can see the change as paying bribes and other forms of corruption are looked down upon

People are able to access public services without paying bribes

  

Even with Leninism which had one party rule, there is an ancient tradition of legalism that is rule by law not of law

Alternative to Confucian compassion

Chin dynasty pioneered the legalist method and unified China but it was the shortest dynasty only 15 years

  

Xi’s anti corruption drive, while initially popular, has resulted in more beurocrqcy and regulations. Mundane things like the size of the dean’s office or his meal allowance require approval from hire ups. The flip side has been the end of term limits and age limits which limited power. Academia is further limited as more topics became off limits. Officials are so focused on not being implicated that they’re paralyzed in making decisions. Decisions made post Covid were an example of this. Everyone is focused on their boss and their favor versus the public good

Why did the chin dynasty fail?

  

The focus now is to remove the incentives for corruption perhaps w higher public salaries and separating the economics from political decision making, rather than deterrence

Moral education rooted in Confucian classics may be used

Could empower junior officials while regulating senior ones

  

Anti corruption drive is over now and fewer officials being punished

More focus on Confucian classics 

  

Chapter 5

Excess drinking without getting drunk ie proving tolerance is rooted in Confucian classics

Conf talked about his ability to hold his liquor and not misbehave

Drunk driving used to be a serious problem 

Eventually Norms were enforced by threat of punishment 

When the norms were solidified, punishment became less necessary 

His use of “ritual” as described by chintza, a Confucian scholar, could be likened to Norms or institutions 

  

Chap 6

Confucian 

Analects should be read as Congtza having a dialogue with and teaching different students

Should first understand the different students as the teachings are tailored individually 

  

Check professor x - intellectual historian descended from Confucian

He taught course on Confucian theory w author at schwartzman college 

  

Shintza political theorist in Confucian tradition who lived during warring states period

Confucian tradition focuses on students individually based on their needs and biases and crafts curriculum 

Seems to based on discussion and rigorous principles not unlike stoicism 

Gives students the benefit of the doubt for a long time 

Don’t give up on them until they’re much older and still lacking ambition 

  

Chapter 7 Marxist comeback

Marxism was fading in favour of Chinese characteristics ie practicality

But had a comeback post GFC when tried to figure out what went wrong 

  

Xi’s focus now is to level playing field for opportunities not income

Cracked down on tech monopolies, real estate bubble, and tutoring only accessible by the rich 

Ie common prosperity - “lower communism” ie focused on opportunities not outcomes

  

Some fear will go against entrepreneurial spirit

  

Marxist scholars faded in the 1980s, but today it’s a prestigious field again with many promising students going into the field

Western media associates this trend strictly with Xi - that without him- would have trended further towards market reforms and electoral democracy

  

Xi is actually following Marx’s theory of history

China was too poor for Marxism during time of mao (which is why he thought it would come to Germany and Uk first)

Needed Deng’s capitalism to create the industry and technology first

Then the workers can rise up and exploit technology for drudge work while they focus on living

Marx recognized capitalisms ability to initially create factors of production efficiency 

  

Ccp never let go of Marxist ideals in 80 and 90s

Private property has a

70 year lease w understanding that it will be taken back 

This is higher communism

Need dictatorship of the proletariat bw capitalism and communism 

Necessary to prevent a ruling class and to develop needed resources 

Marxist end game is an anarchy with no state or ruling class

  

Bakunin the anarchist writer said proletariat wouldn’t let go of power and state would form new elite which rules over rest

Higher communism requires the abolishment of the state

The ditatorship of the proletarian at is supposed to give up power

Marx doesn’t explain how elections will be conducted in a no political fashion 

  

He also says that communism will have to be a global phenomenon as it will be difficult to implement in one country while foreign capitalist countries remain hostile to it 

  

Chinese state has become more beurocrqtic as it’s become more complex. This fits with its Confucian history which selected leaders based on merit and virtue. Increasingly likely that state isn’t going away. Some argue that AI and modern technology will make this easier but it’ll still require human intervention.

  

Ccp is increasingly leaning on Confucian history to teach virtue and ethics to its leaders. Some of the ancient dynasties had a society that resembled communism but with leadership.

  

Great unity in Han dynasty book of rituals 

Poor taken care of and resources are plentiful

Inspired Mao 

  

Chapter 8

Censorship 

Stuart mill is most influential here but he was more afraid of public opinion than state censorship 

This is true of the west today but censorship more important in China 

His classes rarely censored except for Marxism as his interpretation may differ

Rules not enforced to the letter

There is much more censorship with Chinese language publications 

Academic research is increasingly censored esp if in Chinese 

As young ppl grow into leadership and become censors they may be less likely as they value internationalism but they’re also more ideological than in the 1980s when ppl were looking towards the west

  

The author used to be courted by western media who were interested in a foreigner political theorist working in China.

That completely ended in the past few years as

The west’s hostility to China grew. There is zero room for any contrary viewpoints. Everyone agrees that the govnermwnt is evil to its own people and is bent on foreign domination 

  

Partially due to more repression in China but mainly because realization that Chinese aren’t weak and don’t want to be like the west

In the past they looked at western liberalization 

Now there’s more pride in ancient traditions including Confucianism 

Also fear that China will surpass the US

Point is there’s lots of self censorship in the western media

  

Dichotomy between democracies and autocratic not useful

China isn’t run by a family or the military

Run by a meritocratic political system

Has been blocked from western media because of own stupidity but also anti CCP stance of media 

Chinese style repression is worse but iat least is open and will admit why censoring 

Western media won’t admit it - tough to admit when you claim to be committed to free speech 

  

West refuses to see anything other than electoral democracy as legit and denies risk of economic concentration and its effect on democracy 

I’d say this gives too much credit, west has no problem with many autocracies 

  

China is based on politics meritocracy which had some advantages - can focus on long term, chooses the most virtuous leaders, doesn’t empower demagogues who lie, not beholden to economic interest etc

Gives everyone the chance to lead but acknowledges that some lack the moral code to do so 

  

This is the ideal obvs and there is still corruption and the new lack of term limits will be empower incumbents 

In west even this ideal is criticized - id say not because of principles 

  

Chapter 9

Academic meritocracy 

Appointments tend to be fair 

Process can be too rigid for doctoral students

Culture of cuteness

Started in Japan jn the 1970s and spread to rest of east Asia

Pervasive even among professionals 

May sometimes shield real emotions and used in place of real political thought or consciousness 

  

Chapter 11

Symbolic leadership 

Despite ending the imperial system some Confucian scholars argue in favor of a symbolic leader

Only one who would be respected is direct descendant of confuscious

1587 Ming dynasty book

Emperor withdrew from rituals

This shattered the myth of the emperor as divine

Belief was based on those rituals

Good reason why missionaries discouraged ancient rituals in Hawaii 

  

Also powerful when leader only occasionally speaks up and tries to intervene

Appears more objective 

Lessons from the crown 

  

Constitutional monarchies perform well 

Separates rituals and national myths from political leadership

Less likely to have populists

Less likely to fall in love w political leadership as they don’t represent nation in emotional sense

Reminds me of zeus’ advice in Agamemnon book

McArthur kept emperor of Japan in place and was easier to implement land reform as conservatives were assured

Trump and Xi by contrast build cult of personality
