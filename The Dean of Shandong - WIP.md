Bell uses his former position as the Dean of the political theory department at the University of Shandong to explain Chinese political thinking to Western audiences. As the US tries to isolate China and slow its growth, this book attempts to explain the Chinese political system to Westerners. While it is sympathetic to the Chinese system of political meritocracy, It doesn't hesitate to criticize China and President Xi for growing censorship and the abandonment of term limits. Bell is a scholar of Confucianism and he puts contemporary Chinese political theory in the context of its ancient traditions. 


**Resurgence of Confucianism in China**

Confucianism reached its low point during the cultural revolution, but leadership is now trying to make it the public face of the country. The philosophy has never been against economic modernization like many others have (Buddhism?). China has once again become the academic center for Confucianism with many leading professors moving from the US. One academic published reports showing Chinese students are more likely to use confusion dialects to solve problems.

It promotes collective well being and morality, but it took a backseat to specific poverty alleviation during rise of communism. It also puts a heavy focus on meritocracy. Does this unite a large portion of Chinese population? It seems to be the best unifier, especially as Chinese people are increasingly proud of their past. Bell  became interested in it as it related to his study of communitarianism. The school he deans educates CCP members and cadres and is home for retired members. He acknowledges that his political agenda is to de-demonize CCP. He also acknowledges the risk in ending term limits for Xi and issues with the Uigyurs. But he argues that there's no risk of China attacking the US. Conversely, it is surrounded by US bases and has much to fear. 

The CCP is popular even with Chinese abroad and those able to travel. That’s a function of the economic growth in the past 50 years and increases in living standards. Most CCP officials are trying to make things better for the Chinese people, and aren't particularly ideological.  

**Dying Hair**

White air has always been a sign of frailty and so political leaders always dye it black. Xi broke this norm, possibly signifying that he's first among equals. He also led the popular anti-corruption drive which previous leaders weren’t willing to do. But he may have taken his individual leadership (vs the rest of party) too far. 

The government does a disservice with poor translations, including the Ministry of Propaganda. But western governments consider all non-electoral democracies as illegitimate, and they put the CCP in the same category as NK or Saudi without caring about any differences or appreciating its historical legacies with meritocracy. There have been tremendous changes despite one party rule. The author is being generous - the US considers any government that opposes it as illegitimate including electoral democracies. The US either topples them or brands them as authoritarian. It absolutely  appreciates the difference between it and NK which is why it fears China. It worries that the Chinese way may work.

The Suchi system has government appointed bureaucrats who police faculty. They can be annoying as they do censor academics, but they can also be fair. He highlights an episode where an anti-communist former faculty leader wasn’t kicked out of a WeChat group because they hadn’t kicked out other ex-faculty members. He was eventually removed for disruptive comments, but it highlights there is some order.  

Deng sought to avoid the personality cult and established term limits, while he still exercised control when retired. That is, Xi's level of authority isn't completely unprecedented.  

Administrative positions are prestigious even though they pay less. This is an ancient tradition where leadership was through meritocracy except for the emperor. In Shandong, 7 is the lucky number because of the phrase "57 up, 58 down" meaning up or out at 57.

Collective leadership may be a good thing, but certain conditions necessary. There needs to be a first among equals who has moral and formal authority. Dissent should be allowed and encouraged. Emperors in China were absolute rulers, but decisions were recorded for posterity which was a partial check. Corruption, that is the use of public funds for private use is the worst thing a Confucian leader can do. It's cited as a contributor to the fall of the Ming and Chin dynasties. It was also a factor in the CCP's victory over the KMT who were able to appeal to the people.  

Mao wasn’t guilty of corruption for money but was drunk with power. People died because of persecution and poor policies. After Deng opened up the economy, many officials starting looking for their cut. Corruption became rampant, reaching a tipping point in 2012 when Xi took over. Polls showed corruption was the public’s number 1 issue with the system e.g. University admissions was perceived as unfair. Xi's predecessors half heartedly went after corruption. They recognized it as a threat to CCP rule though.  

Xi punished 1m officials including a dozen high ranking military officials. The West portrays this as going after his enemies, but he made many enemies by going after so many people and disturbing practices. People can see the change as paying bribes and other forms of corruption are looked down upon. People are able to access public services without paying bribes.  

Even with Leninism which had one party rule, there is an ancient tradition of legalism that is rule by law not of law. It's the alternative to Confucian compassion. The Chin dynasty pioneered the legalist method and unified China but it was the shortest dynasty, lasting only 15 years.  

Xi’s anti corruption drive, while initially popular, has resulted in more bureaucracy and regulations. Mundane things like the size of the dean’s office or his meal allowance require approval from hire ups. The flip side has been the end of term limits and age limits which limited power. Academia is further limited as more topics became off limits. Officials are so focused on not being implicated that they’re paralyzed in making decisions. Decisions made post Covid were an example of this. Everyone is focused on their boss and their favor versus the public good.

The focus now is to remove the incentives for corruption perhaps with higher public salaries and separating the economics from political decision making, rather than deterrence. Moral education rooted in Confucian classics may be used. They could empower junior officials while regulating senior ones. The anti-corruption drive is over now and fewer officials are being punished. There's more focus on the Confucian classics for teaching morality.   

**Chapter 5**

Excess drinking without getting drunk i.e. proving tolerance is rooted in Confucian classics. Confucious talked about his ability to hold his liquor and not misbehave. Drunk driving used to be a serious problem, but eventually norms were enforced by the threat of punishment. When the norms were solidified, punishment became less necessary. His use of “rituals” as described by chintza, a Confucian scholar, could be likened to Norms or institutions. 

**Chapter 6**

Confucian Analects should be read as Congtza having a dialogue with and teaching different students. One should first understand the different students as the teachings are tailored individually.    

Shintza was a political theorist in the Confucian tradition who lived during warring states period. The Confucian tradition focuses on students individually based on their needs and biases and crafts the curriculum accordingly. It seems to based on discussion and rigorous principles not unlike stoicism. It gives students the benefit of the doubt for a long time, and doesn't give up on them until they’re much older and still lacking ambition.
  
**Chapter 7 Marxist comeback**

Marxism was fading in favour of Chinese characteristics i.e. practicality, but it had a comeback post GFC when the government tried to figure out what went wrong. Xi’s focus now is to level the playing field for opportunities, not income. He cracked down on tech monopolies, real estate bubbles, and tutoring which was only accessible to the rich. He favored common prosperity - “lower communism” - which focused on opportunities not outcomes. Some fear this will go against the entrepreneurial spirit. 

Marxist scholars faded in the 1980s, but today it’s a prestigious field again with many promising students. Western media associates this trend strictly with Xi, that without him it would have trended further towards market reforms and electoral democracy. Xi is actually following Marx’s theory of history. China was too poor for Marxism during the time of Mao (which is why he thought it would come to Germany and the UK first). They first needed Deng’s capitalism to create the industry and technology. Then the workers can rise up and exploit technology for drudge work while they focus on living. 
Marx recognized capitalism's ability to initially create factors of production efficiency.   

The CCP never let go of Marxist ideals in the 1980 and 90s. Private property has a 70 year lease with the understanding that it will be taken back at some point. This is higher communism. A dictatorship of the proletariat is required between the  capitalist and communist phases. It's necessary to prevent a ruling class and to develop needed resources. The Marxist end game is an anarchy with no state or ruling class.  

Bakunin the anarchist writer said that the proletariat wouldn’t let go of power and the state would form a new elite which rules over rest. Higher communism requires the abolishment of the state. The dictatorship of the proletariat is supposed to give up power. Marx doesn’t explain how elections will be conducted in a non-political fashion. 
He also says that communism will have to be a global phenomenon as it will be difficult to implement in one country while foreign capitalist countries remain hostile to it.  

The Chinese state has become more bureaucratic as it’s become more complex. This fits with its Confucian history which selected leaders based on merit and virtue. It's increasingly likely that the state isn’t going away. Some argue that AI and modern technology will make this easier, but it’ll still require human intervention. 

The CCP is increasingly leaning on Confucian history to teach virtue and ethics to its leaders. Some of the ancient dynasties had a society that resembled communism but with leadership. The Great Unity in Han dynasty's book of rituals for example. In it the poor were taken care of and resources were plentiful. This may have inspired Mao. 

**Chapter 8**- **Censorship** 

John Stuart Mill is most influential writer on censorship, but he was more afraid of public opinion than state censorship. This is true in the West today, but censorship is more important in China. The author's classes are rarely censored except for Marxism, as his interpretation may differ. Rules around censorship are not enforced to the letter, and there is much more censorship with Chinese language publications. Academic research is increasingly censored esp if in Chinese 

As young ppl grow into leadership and become censors they may be less likely as they value internationalism but they’re also more ideological than in the 1980s when ppl were looking towards the west

  

The author used to be courted by western media who were interested in a foreigner political theorist working in China.

That completely ended in the past few years as

The west’s hostility to China grew. There is zero room for any contrary viewpoints. Everyone agrees that the govnermwnt is evil to its own people and is bent on foreign domination 

  

Partially due to more repression in China but mainly because realization that Chinese aren’t weak and don’t want to be like the west

In the past they looked at western liberalization 

Now there’s more pride in ancient traditions including Confucianism 

Also fear that China will surpass the US

Point is there’s lots of self censorship in the western media

  

Dichotomy between democracies and autocratic not useful

China isn’t run by a family or the military

Run by a meritocratic political system

Has been blocked from western media because of own stupidity but also anti CCP stance of media 

Chinese style repression is worse but iat least is open and will admit why censoring 

Western media won’t admit it - tough to admit when you claim to be committed to free speech 

  

West refuses to see anything other than electoral democracy as legit and denies risk of economic concentration and its effect on democracy 

I’d say this gives too much credit, west has no problem with many autocracies 

  

China is based on politics meritocracy which had some advantages - can focus on long term, chooses the most virtuous leaders, doesn’t empower demagogues who lie, not beholden to economic interest etc

Gives everyone the chance to lead but acknowledges that some lack the moral code to do so 

  

This is the ideal obvs and there is still corruption and the new lack of term limits will be empower incumbents 

In west even this ideal is criticized - id say not because of principles 

  

Chapter 9

Academic meritocracy 

Appointments tend to be fair 

Process can be too rigid for doctoral students

Culture of cuteness

Started in Japan jn the 1970s and spread to rest of east Asia

Pervasive even among professionals 

May sometimes shield real emotions and used in place of real political thought or consciousness 

  

Chapter 11

Symbolic leadership 

Despite ending the imperial system some Confucian scholars argue in favor of a symbolic leader

Only one who would be respected is direct descendant of confuscious

1587 Ming dynasty book

Emperor withdrew from rituals

This shattered the myth of the emperor as divine

Belief was based on those rituals

Good reason why missionaries discouraged ancient rituals in Hawaii 

  

Also powerful when leader only occasionally speaks up and tries to intervene

Appears more objective 

Lessons from the crown 

  

Constitutional monarchies perform well 

Separates rituals and national myths from political leadership

Less likely to have populists

Less likely to fall in love w political leadership as they don’t represent nation in emotional sense

Reminds me of zeus’ advice in Agamemnon book

McArthur kept emperor of Japan in place and was easier to implement land reform as conservatives were assured

Trump and Xi by contrast build cult of personality
