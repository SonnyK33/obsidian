The Dark Ages were a regression intellectually, but not all human progress stopped. The Black Death, the bubonic plague and others killed 30-50pct of the population. Those who survived stopped working (mainly in agriculture), which caused wages to spike. The government imposed a wage freeze. Taxes were also raised to pay for the 100 years war. This led to peasants revolting. A lot of parallels to the post-covid period. It was similar to the warring state’s period or the death of Alexander in Greece. 

Erasmus was the start of humanism. He called out the corruption of church. He believed ignorance was bliss, and that to be human meant some level of ignorance. More knowledge just complicates your life.

There's some passage in the Bible which means you’ll be happy when you’re ready to be who you are. This reminds me of Meditations, where Aurelius says that we must accept our place in the world. We're all part of a greater system and we must be true to ourselves rather that worry about others.
