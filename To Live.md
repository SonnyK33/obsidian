By Yu Hua

To Live tells the story of twentieth century [[China]], from a feudal state to a communist one through the life of one man, Fugui. The son of a wealthy landowner, Fugui starts off as a selfish gambler who loses the family fortune at a casino. He has servants and is spoiled by his priviliege. 

Various events in Chinese history- land reform, the [[cultural revolution]], the great leap forward- are described through Fugui. After his family loses its property, he's forced into the military (presumably by Nationalist forces) in the run up to the [[Chinese Civil War]]. After he's able to return home he's forced to endure poverty he had never experienced before. His family initially benefits from collectivist policies which provide him with food and shelter. Through all of the forced reforms, he endures tragedy after tragedy. All of the members of his immediate family die. He finds a suitable match for his daugther and has a grandchild. HIs daughter later dies while delivering another child. He describes the corruption and incompetence present in the hospital - direct effects from the Cultural Revolution. HIs son-in-law and grandson also eventually die. The story ends with him alone, but with a donkey - his one modest goal achieved. 

The story is critical of [[Mao]]'s reforms but also of the pre-communist fedual state and the Nationalist forces. In sum, the novel shows how policies enacted by powerful forces often cause immense harm on ordinary individuals.
