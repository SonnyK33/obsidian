Singapore is one of the 20th century's greatest success stories that many believe should be copied. What many don’t say (or know) is that Singapore became successful through compulsory land expropriation.

Singapore expropriated land from private owners and limited compensation during its initial development phase. That allowed it to limit the cost of new housing and the development of its business districts. The author contrasts it with South Africa who only took land from willing sellers. 

Pettis describes how developing countries may need to do this to achieve high levels of investment. Savings rates are low because rule of law is limited and institutions aren’t fully developed. It’s interesting how all of the EM success stories used a pattern of development that would be condemned today. Post apartheid South Africa never attempted this level of redistribution. The same is true for India where savings rates are too low (as argued in recent Mody article).
