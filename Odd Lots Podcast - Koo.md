Follow-ups: 
- When did the US turn to fiscal stimulus during GFC?
- how does the balance sheet recession fit with Pettis' description of what happened to Japan?

A balance sheet recession is when everyone is paying down debt such that consumption stops. In this scenario, the central government must provide fiscal stimulus. China will benefit from being aware of Japan's experience. When the US accepted this, turned to fiscal rather than relying on monetary. Japan's property bubble was worse, as they had 80-90pct property crashes. 

What matters is debt less savings. China has a lot of savings in the central government which will have to support local governments who can’t sell land as easily. They need to help the property sector and make sure that unfinished properties are built. This would be the best thing to help consumer sentiment and their willingness to spend. Direct payments to consumers will just go towards paying down debt. Trade surpluses help but they can’t go any further without pushback. Chinese population declines make it more challenging;  Japanese population continued to grow for 20 yrs after bubble burst (1990-2009).
