An example with high variable costs:

You sell 10 apples for $1 and your COGS are 90 cents per apple so your gross profit is $0.10 per apple. You make $1 in gross profit.  

you would prefer to raise prices by x% than the quantity by the same amount. If you raise prices by 10pct, gross profit is $0.20 x 10 = $2
If you raise quantity by 10pct, gross profit is $0.10 x 11 = $1.10 

Your gross profit doubled vs increasing by 10pct. 
The lower your gross margins, the more you’ll lean on price. Elasticity is the trade off. 
If you raised prices by 10pct, you’re better off as long as you sell at least half as many apples. That is, as long as price elasticity is less than -5.  

If your gross margins are high (low variable costs), the benefit of raising prices vs quantity goes down. If variable costs are zero, the two are equivalent.  If costs were $0.10 per apple:

$0.9 x 10 = $9 base case 
$1 x 10 = $10 with the price increase
$0.9 x 11 = $9.9 with the quantity increase.  

You’re better off with the price increase as long as you sell 9 apples, so elasticity can’t exceed 1 (10pct price increase leads to 10pct quantity decrease). So with high gross margin businesses, you require more elastic goods (all things equal).  

If you instead aim to sell 10pct more apples by lowering your prices, you’re better off as long as you don’t cut gross profit to less than 9/11=$0.82.

0.82 x 11 = $9

This equates to $0.92 per apple or an 8pct price decrease. So if you’re high gross margin, and you have an elastic good, you’ll want to cut prices.
