Pension fund managers value liabilities using a gilt yield that fell to historic lows during GFC and post Covid. That caused liabilities to increase and would have required higher contributions. The solution was to take on leverage through repos, using their assets as collateral, and investing in higher yield securities like equities and real estate.  

In the US pensions can use corporate yields which are higher and thus less conservative for valuing liabilities. In the Uk there’s a national regulator whose responsible if a pension goes insolvent hence being more conservative.The budget crisis caused yields to spike and lowered asset values. This caused a spiral of sales and further value reductions. UK pension funds use a lot more leverage than US or Dutch ones.  

The increase in gilt yields also caused liabilities to fall so their pension surpluses actually increased. Hence it was a liquidity not solvency issue.

  
The broader issue is that post GFC, regulations caused risks to shift from banks to less regulated entities. Banks can’t take the kind of risks they took before and can’t provide liquidity requiring others to fill the gap. A more widespread collateralizatjon of derivatives which was meant to reduce counterparty risk has also led to the actions of one entity (eg pension funds) to affect rest of system. One legacy of ultra low yields is that pension funds had been consistent sellers of equities and buyers of gilts since the early 2000s. Their ownership of domestic equities went from 22pct in 1998 to 2pct in 2020. Given the fall in gilts that means less to pay out. Discretionary increases to make up for inflation may not happen and defined contribution plans are even worse. All in all it means less money for pensioners.
