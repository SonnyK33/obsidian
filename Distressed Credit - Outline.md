Covenant Review - AMC Entertainment: Will the 1L Bonds Allow the Company To Use a Drop-Down Transaction to Refinance 2L Bonds?
Tickers: #AMC, #AMZN 

**Change of Control**
Many credit documents have change of control puts, sometimes with a rating trigger, sometimes without. 





**Drop Down Transactions**
These transactions require capacity for investments in unrestricted subsidiaries. This capacity could come from:
1) General purpose capacity under the Restricted Payments covenant to make Restricted Invesments in Unrestricted Subsidiaries
2) Capacity under Permitted Investments basket that allows Investments in Unrestricted SUbs
3) Can also conduct drop-down transactions within the restricted group. For example in Bausch, investments among the restricted group are unlimited per the credit agreement. So to the extent there is capacity for non-guarantor restricted subs to borrow, that new debt would be structurally senior to existing debt (but still in the restricted group).


**AMC**
**Change of Control**
There's been reports that AMZN may consider acquiring AMC. While this is unlikely, it must be considered since we have a 1st lien / 2nd lien decompression trade on.

In AMC's case, the CoC provisons in the 1st and 2nd lien documents give a 101 put if AMZN acquires AMC's equity or substantially all assets. 

**Drop Down**
Provisions in the credit agreement governing the term loan and 1st lien indentures prevent outright purchases of second lien notes. However, equity issuances build capacity to buyback second lien notes. 

AMC's 1st lien indentures allow it to  divert assets to unrestricted subs using 1) and 2) in the above criteria. There are several baskets that give capacity fur such an investment (see Covenant Review - AMC Entertainment: Will the 1L Bonds Allow the Company To Use a Drop-Down Transaction to Refinance 2L Bonds?). The Minimum Dollar-Capped Unrestricted Sub Investments Capacity alone grants $2.75bn.

There are restrictions on using this capacity to prepay junior financing, but there is an "Excluded Contribution Amount" basket that could be used, and it alone has ~1.5bn. Interestingly, there is a provision in the 2L indentures that prohibits diverting assets to Unrestricted Subsidiaries. But if these notes are taken out in a refinancing, they wouldn't be operative anymore. Amendment and waiver provisions in the 2L notes would allow them to strip out this covenant as an exit consent. This could be granted in connection with a transaction which borrows against a new unrestricted subsidiary to repay the 2L holders. While the 1L notes have a provision which may prevent this, it may not be adequate. There are arguments on both sides. All things considered, this is a realistic possibility.
