Dec/22 Political Crisis
Barclays call 12.20.22 Notes - 
-   Protests aren’t massive but are violent – the first time in a while
-   Congress can’t be reelected, so makes sense they didn’t vote for early elections
-   Macro buffers in place and fiscal situation is strong
-   Fiscal situation is strong due to commodity prices
-   S&P downgraded:
	- During pandemic, increased reliance on external debt and amount of debt held by foreign investors
	-   Partially due to withdrawal of local pensions which decreased ability to absorb local debt
- strong commodity prices may prevent a downgrade 

Themes - 
-   Likely to be a trend in Latam: High commodity prices -> geopolitical volatility -> desire for more distributive polices -> more left winged governments -> closer to China
- being long Latam in the medium term will be a carry trade relying on strong commodity prices
- short Latam is betting on periodic geopolitical volatility - political crises, stronger trade relations with China, etc
- US' role in Castillo's removal still isn't clear
