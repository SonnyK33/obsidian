Overview:

Binder describes the different approaches to fiscal and monetary policy taken by administrations and the Federal Reserve from the early 1960s through the Biden administration. He focuses on the interplay between budget actions and interest rates and how the economy responded. He also discusses how Keynesian approaches went in and out of favour.

Key Lessons:




Notes:

**Chapter 1 - Fiscal Policy on the New Frontier**
Kennedy was the first president to use fiscal policy (a tax cut) to stimulate the economy when it wasn't in a recession. Following his assassination, Johnson continued expanding the budget with his war in Vietnam. He refused to rein in spending or increase taxes as it would make war less popular.

Loose fiscal policy plus tighter monetary (which is the norm) leads to higher rates and decreases the share of GDP going to investment. The budget deficits lead to more consumption and less savings.   

Regulation Q - a leftover policy from the Great Depression - put a cap on deposit rates. Based on the argument that part of the depression was caused by the ruinous competition for deposits. It has since been dismantled, but in the 1960s, it led to disintermediation when the fed rose rates. Depositors left banks for other instruments when market rates went above the cap. This hurt the housing sector as there less money to fund mortgages. This was before the government sponsored entities were created to stimulate the housing market. 
  
Under Breton Woods, the USD was fixed against major currencies, and this restricted what the Fed could do. It couldn’t depreciate its exchange rate when inflation exceeded Germany's for example. Instead, gold would leave the country. This became a secular issue and eventually led to the end of the gold standard. 

Fed chair Martin was the longest serving chair of the Fed and like all previous heads, he had no formal Economics training. At the time most Fed chairs came from Wall Street. The head of the CEA was a Keynesian but also believed in contractionary policies when they were warranted. Johnson passed surtaxes (at the time, the Fed said contractionary policies should come from government not Fed). This eventually lowered growth but inflation continues to rise as unemployment was still below the natural rate.   


**Chapter 2 - Inflation and the Rise of Monetarism**

Monetarism emerged as a new economic theory based on the importance of the moeny supply. Monetarists, led by Friedman, argued the Fed should be affecting policy by targeting money supply. He argued fiscal deficits don’t matter if they're accompanied by bond issuance. This requires you to believe that demand for money is inelastic that is not dependent on rates - which many dispute. 

Monetarism assumes a vertical LM curve. See [[ISLM Model]] and [[Monetarism]].



Greenspan ended

Policy of following money aggregates which had been a legal requirement

Friedman thought fiscal deficits only inflationary if financed mainly through printing money 

  

His k pct rule - monetary growth should equal gdp growth plus inflation. 

Monetarists argued Fed should target M (money supply) rather than r

  

See paper from Poole- Friedman student

If M is fixed, get IS LM system where r and y will shift in response to changes for demand for money (LM shocks) or real spending (IS shocks)

  

If r is fixed, letting M fluctuate, LM shocks become irrelevant and only IS shocks matter though they have a bigger impact than when upward sloping LM cushions impact 

So targeting M cushions iM shocks but brings LM shocks , so depends on which you’re more worried about 

Poole argued we knew more about M than real incomes so should target M..

Was proven wrong w innovations spurred by regulation q

  

Many monetarists argued expanding money supply would lead to inflation 

Eg QE in 2010 - but it didn’t happen 

Same thing post Covid,

Though it did that time 

  

Monetarism grew due to inflation in 1970s and 60s and Keynesiam was blamed

Monetarism fell out of favor as velocity of money became more erratic 

Friedman father of the school was taught by Arthur burns 

  

Keynesian thought in the 50s prior to Phillips paper was crude and allowed for inflation on or

Off regimes

After full employment, more demand (from fiscal or Monterey policy) only increases inflation w not impact on output.. and the opposite before full employment 




**Chapter 3 - The Phillips Curve Becomes Vertical**

Philips curve bridges gap by giving menu of choices between unemployment and inflation. 

Left to simplistic bifurcation bw liberal and conservative economists 

  

Friedman argued the curve was not taking into account inflation expectations and in the long term the curve is vertical based on general equilibrium 

If unemployment was below the natural rate ustar,

That would push up inflation expectations and inflation,

Businesses would realize this before workers

And raise prices and so real wages would go down and firms will hire more ppl 

Eventually workers

Will demand higher

Wages bringing up real wages and lower hiring which will bring unemployment back to ustar 

So monetary policy won’t deviate unemployment from natural rate and curve is vertical



**Chapter 4 - Nixon, Burns, and the Political Business Cycle**

Eventually rational expectations theory went against some of the vertical curve arguments 

  

Burns and Nixon

Burns warned Nixon about a looming recession and said to loosen credit and increase spending 

Recession happened and he lost to Kennedy

When Nixon became President later he appointed him

The country still had tight monetary and fiscal policy enacted by Johnson to combat inflation which worked but also created a short recession 

Nixon in response called himself a Keynesian

Stimulus generally leads to real growth first followed by inflation 

  

Nixon goosed economy w fiscal stimulus- higher social security spending 

Was also revealed post watergate that burns was likely trying to help Nixon get reelection 

His plan was to stimulate economy w fiscal and monetary get re-elected and then deal w inflation 

He enacted price controls soon after reelection

  

In 1973 Nixon unilaterally ended bretton woods by ending convertibility to gold

The US had ma y years of

Gold outflows which led

To this

Ending the fixed exchange rates removed monetary constraints for all who participated esp non-US countries

Who had to use monetary policy to maintain rate

This was one of the causes of worldwide inflation post this year

But it was a global issue even for counties whose currency appreciated meaning there were other issues notably supply constraints 

Although the Us was less constrained by the system, it’s end freed

Up the fed as well

  

Fed doubled fed

Funds to 10 pct

To fight inflation which went up 400 bps

Arab Israeli war led to opec increasing oil prices pushing US to recession 

This was dubbed stagflation and central banks didn’t know how to deal w it

They went back and forth from

Fighting inflation to recession

Pre election stimulus faded

And have way to contravionaty policy  

After going back and forth the policies ended up restrictive 

It was clear ththat cycle in 71-73 was created politically,

  

Price controls were seen as negative and never attempted again 

Political manipulation plus the backlash against price controls killed the political business cycle 

His manipulation is a key legacy of Nixon 

  

  

  

Legacy of burns is fanning inflation and aiding Nixons manipulation 

Although oil shocks were also to blame

Burns encouraged nixons use of price controls 

Loose policies of early 70s contributed to inflation even as he spoke out against inflation

  

He increased stimulus again in the late 70s - 76-78 m1 and m2 increases by high single digits 

He didn’t believe central

Banks could affect the inflation rate and told the senate banking committee as much

He blames inflation on social democratic policies -

New deal, great societies

**Chapter 5 - Stagflation and Its Aftermath**

Stglation was caused by supply shocks - oil prices from opec and food prices

Demand shocks cause prices and output to move in the same direction

Supply shocks cause the opposite - a negative correlation bw inflation and growth ie stagflation 

They were not well known at the time and went against what the Philips curve predicted 

  

Neoclassical predicted lower real wages but not higher unemployment due to these shocks 

They also expected a lower hit to gdp

This discrepancy was due to wealth effect of lower stock market (72 and 73 worst years ever in real terms) and a nominal tax system that was implicit tightening - taxed nominal gains

There were two other channels related to lower worker productivity-

Busjnesss didn’t realize productivity had gone down and so gave bigger real wage increases than warranted - this increases unit labour prices and causes inflation and higher unemployment 

  

Policymakers also didn’t realize and targeted higher levels of growth leading to inflation 

Both of these raise the nairu and they’ll then aim for a level of labour market tightness that’s inflationary

Poor productivity on its own and due to the errors it led to in monetary policy led to stagflation 

  

Can see the lower productivity in labors higher share of income 

  

Friedman believed high relative prices ie oil prices shouldn’t cause inflation only higher money supply would

Higher oil prices should lower other prices 

  

In reality higher relative prices cause inflation bc other things don’t necessarily get cheaper due to  rigidities and an inflationary demand shock will change relative prices 

Ie causality runs both ways when prices and wages are sticky

In response to oil price shock, monetarists gave clear guidance to cut money supply 

Keynesians had no obvious solution as said couldn’t address inflation and recession at same

Time 

  

It was possible to deal with hit to demand with combo of fiscal and monetary policies

Firms w large energy needs

We’re forced to use more

Labour 

This meant more labour costs for the same output and hence decreased labour productivity 

The fed misses this and loosened more than they should’ve 

Real wages also went too high by missing this and led to more unemployment 

May be seeing same thing today w return of union power




**Chapter 6 - Inflation and the Rational Expectations Revolution**

Lucas led the revolution to rational expectations 

Carter appointed various business people to his cabinet

Carters replace t for burns didn’t know how the Fed worked

He was unable to pass fiscal stimulus due to congress obsession w balanced budgets

  

He did pass new payroll tax credits which incentivized pay raises 

Was a more efficient use of funds bc it targeted marginal behavior vs actions that would

Happen anyways

Obama had something similar in stimulus bill

Carter’s attempt at tax reform didn’t work - by the time got through congress was just a big

Tax cut as big as the previous stimulus so

Was a double stimulus

Was like too much fiscal stimulus and inflation ensued

The dollar also weakened against German and Japan - world still getting used to floating rates

Carter sold gold

And borrowed from

The IMF for the first time

Also issued bonds in German marks and Swiss Francs for first and last time 

Carter passed the law which gave fed dual mandate - one of the few

Central

Banks to have employment mandate along w inflation 

  

Iranian revolution and war w Iraq led to another supply shock - oil component spikes 50pct

Monetarists still blamed inflation on money supply (bc again oil prices were relative and should cause other prices to fall) and bc core inflation also rose a Lot

Latter could

Be bc supply

Shocks cause pass through into other components

Aggregate demand was up however signaling too much stimulus from the prior period

The overstating of labour productivity may have been the cause

Fed chair miller also deserves blame as he didn’t think monetary policy was the primary cause of inflation 

Unemployment was only 0.5pp below the natural rate at the time which shouldn’t have caused so much inflation

Question - how does labour productivity affect natural rate ?

Cpi also overstated inflation by including nominal mortgage rates - so caused positive feedback loop

**Chapter 7 - Carter, Volcker, and the Conquest of Inflation**

After his malaise speech Carter appointed volker

Who was a known hawk and head of NY fed

Carter knew he would

Tighten policy and possibly cost him reelection 

Volker thought he wouldn’t get the nomination when he told Carter he wvalued

Fed independence and fighting inflation

Contrast w Nixon and burns

  

Long end rates went up after Volker appointment 

Ie onflation expctetioms didn’t immediately come down causing long end rates to fall

He announced a

Switch from

Focus on fed funds to money supply

But due to regulations on rates and

Ficmaial innovation was hard to reduce M1 initially

Fed funds also went up

Carter used an authority leftover from Nixons time to impose credit constraints. He believed excess credit was the problem but the fed disagreed. They imposed controls but had carveouts for houses or cars. Money supply growth dropped but so did gdp growth (8pct decline) and hence rates also fell

People cooperated

W Carter and cut up credit cards

**Chapter 8 - Reganomics and the Clash between Monetary and Fiscal Policy**

Carters credit controls created a

Recession as did volkers tight money

Those two recessions ended inflation

They abandoned monetarism as it hadn’t worked and inflation was defeated

  

Volker was an undersecretary under Nixon when bretton woods was abandoned

He was a supporter of fixed rates and so likely opposed the change 

  

Reagan

Econ policy shapes by supply side which was influenced by Laffer

Laffer curve - could raise Revenue by cutting taxes

Never have any evidence that US was on the right side of the curve

Republicans later denied he said that although idea was repeated by bush jr and trump

  

Unlike Carter Reagan blew up the budget 

Expansionary fiscal policy given credit for fixing

The economy

But the recession and the breaking of inflation was already achieved via volkers tight policy which started a year earlier 

  

During a debate Regan asked whether you were better off from 4 yrs ago - real gdp per capita was actually up 8pct

But ppl

Felt poorer due to prev recession and inflation

Reagan’s tax cuts created deficits which were unprecedented for peacetime 

  

Tax cuts kicked in just as economy was recovering late 70s recession

Monetary policy also loosened by then 

  

Tax cuts spurred Econ growth from the demand side not supply

Growth rate in real terms for first term was about the same as during carters first term 

So even after coming out of recession,

Growth was average 

But rate of growth was accelerating just as he went to reelection 

  

Tight monetary policy should push up real rates and slow demand 

Loose fiscal policy should also push up real rates but speed up demand

Putting them together should raise real rates, effect on demand depends which is more powerful

Supply siders argued that they could spur growth w expansionary fiscal policies and simultaneously control inflation w tight monetary policy

Economist Mundell endorsed this idea

Though it went against his previous work 

In reality real rates went up a lot which lowered the share of investment in the economy and pushed up the dollar 

This hurt ameicnan exporters and led to the plaza accord whiter G5 countries agreed to let the dollar devalue 

  

Large budget deficits crowd out net exports along w investment 

US trade deficit continued to grow 

  

Legacy of Regan was republicans don’t care about deficits - they’ve been much larger post him than before

They also seek to cut taxes regardless of the macro situation

Bc republicans cut regardless

And then democrats have to try to reduce

Deficit,

The fed became responsible for stabilization since Regan. 

  

Mundell Fleming models on fixed and floating rates

His work on optimal currency

Areas argue against the euro even though he’s called father of the euro

**Chapter 9 - The Long Expansion of the 1980s**

Great moderation 

The period post the early 80s recession

Gdp volatility came down 

Regan passed

Tax reform which eliminated many tax shelters

Nominal and real rates declines steadily since 1981

The former is due to inflation expectations coming down  

The latter due to more complex issues - rise of China w high

Savings rates, new tech requiring less investment 

  

Nominal rates did briefly go up due to fiscal policy 

Baker ordered Volker to not raise rates but he wasn’t planning to anyways

Regan appointees at the FOMC tried to cut the discount rate (out of the blue) but Volker threatened to resign and so they took it back 

  

Volker didn’t want another term which was ok w baker 

They nominated Greenspan who was seen as political as was Nixons advisor 

  

Savings and loans

 Banks lent 30yr and had short deposits 

Sufferers losses when rates increased and inverted

Some banks made risky loans to cover losses 

Depositors needed to be bailed out

Fed responded

To Black Friday by saying they were available to supply

Liquidity to any banks (through the discount window) that needed it 

Greenspan earned markets trust 

  

Fed tightened in late 80s and inflation moderated

Unemployment was thought to be below natural rate,

Justifying the hike 

Memories of 80s inflation was still fresh

First gulf war spiked oil and pushed US into a short recession 

Fed was forced to raise rates due to inflation spike 

Then went back to cutting 

  

Unemployment rate kept rising til 92

Jobless recovery

  

Bush blamed his failed reelection in greespan saying he wasn’t sufficiently expansive 

  

Oil spiked caused a mini stagflation and fed knew they couldn’t fight both simultaneously 

They settled for a quick bout of inflation and then a quick recession

  

There wasn’t much in the fiscal front except for the previous tax reform 

The preoccupation was then w cutting deficits

**Chapter 10 - Deficits Crowd Out Fiscal Policy, 1982 - 1998**

Deficits crowd our private investment but there’s no political incentive to eliminate them 

  

Regan’s

GRA law imposed mandatory budget cuts of deficit targets not met

Was

Riled unconstotutopnal and overturned 

Wouldn’t eliminated automatic stabilizers in a recession

Congress has liimited control over budget 

Only over annual appropriations 

And eligibility for entitlements

Bush’s budget plan cleaned up the savings and loan mess and started the trek to a balanced bugwet 

But he was punished for raising taxes

Bush was punished politically but his counter cyclical paygo policies made sense

  

**Chapter 11 - The Long Boom of the 1990s**

Clinton

Democrats pre Regan we’re known as tax and spenders 

Changed w Clinton though he didn’t run on deficit reduction 

May have seen Perot’s success as evidence that the public cares about it since that was his whole campaign

Robert Rubin from GS cared about it as well

Lloyd benson was getting messages from

Greenspan who was also pushing it 

Political advisors and Robert reich were against too big of a cut 

Even Robert was okay w cutting but didn’t want the 140 of cuts

Wanted 120 - a small difference over 5 years

Clinton went for the bigger cuts and 30 yr went from 7.3 to 5.9

The deficit reduction was rear loaded 

Also made small cuts to SS - made

Some

Income taxable for upper earners

This was unusual for democrats and hence made the plan seem credible to the market

 Cutting fiscal deficits should lower rates which encourages investment and capital formation

That should improve productivity and real wages 

  

Clinton wanted to sell the deficit reduction plan as a

Job creator not just the complex argument that it would improve real wages

Bc the public was dealing w a jobless recovery and was most focused on jobs

  

The idea that fiscal cuts and tax raisss  could grow the eco even in the short term took hold though it made no sense 

  

Rubin endorsed this negative multiplier theory arguing that it reduces the odds of something bad happening in the future

  

Bad as in a currency crisis

Which causes capital to flee and/or rising default risk which causes rates to spike and a recession

Those were all unlikely 

Wouldn’t default on own debt 

  

Bettwrnargument was if can convince market debt won’t grow in future that would lower rates today and create more investment

Still doesn’t show negative multiplier

  

Politicos learned the wrong lessons -

Deficit cuts won’t always lower yields

Have to be starting from high yields

Have a period of irresponsible spending 

And a change in govt w new credible policies

Many became convinced that fiscal contraction was the key to growing economy forgetting the special conditions that worked for Clinton 

  

Clinton boom actually started under Bush

91 recession caused by oil shock from Iraq war 

Public thought Econ was in decline even when it was growing under bush 

His party was mad about taxes

Bush blamed Greenspan for the recession 

Sec Brady tried to convince G and called FOMC members directly to no avail

Clinton was beneficiaries of business cycle

  

Clinton got no republicans support for deficit reduction and only 50/57 democrats in the senate 

  

Knew that bush lost partially due to the fed, was hoping Fed would

Cut as a reward for cutting deficit

Greenspan didn’t commit to do so

Rubin knew the fed couldn’t do much more as fed funds was close to zero in real terms and it was up to bond market 

Bond market came through and ensured deficit cuts weren’t contractionary

Guided by Rubin Clinton didn’t

Go to war w Fed like bush

The fed increases rates 25

Despite the deficit reduction greatly angering Clinton 

His advisors

Said real fed funds

Had been at zero for too long anyways and if he criticized him publicly that would boost rates further and may cause fed to prove independence by raising more

They maintained

A policy

If not commenting on the

Fed

  

The fed kept

Hiking raising to 6 from 3pct.

At one point market was pricing in 8pct ff

Greenspan was the first to issue forward guidance

The author thought Fed could be overdoing it but vice chair has never dissented before 

Real rates went from 0 to 3 as inflation was flat

The 30 year went up 140 bps suing the period

Unemployment was at 5.4’which was thought to be close to natural rate 

  

Rate was

5.5 when 98 recession Caused by LTCM and Russian default

Cut 75 bps during this period

And Greenspan along w Rubin and summers were credited w saving the world

  

The boom of the late 90s was driven more by cuts earlier in Clinton’s term than the smaller cuts in 97

The surplus

Increased without any change in policy

Many new

Jobs created as well

Labour productivity also increased a lot

As the Econ was

Growing well in the late 90s even dovish FOMC members like yellen wanted to raise

Rates. Unlike in the past Greenspan resisted. He predicted the productivity gains from technology and anticipated that the Econ could handle more

Even as unemployment went down there wasn’t any inflation

  

In 1990 central Bank independence

Was

Rare

Only in US kind of, Switzerland and Germany

By end of decade

Most dev and many EM had indep banks

The success in fighting inflation esp in Germany and Switzerland were main motivators

Paper on time inconsistencies which won Nobel prize got too much credit for this

Few in policy

Knew about it 

  

Fiscal policy was no longer used as a lever and many stuck to the claim

That a lower deficit stimulates the economy 

Against Keynesian thought

**Chapter 12 - The 2000s - The Job-loss Recovery and the Bubbles**

Bush

Gore ran as a fiscal conservative and even said debt to be paid off by 2012 and that it entitlement spending in a lock box

Priory to election lots of debates

For what to do w surpluses

  

Fed wasn’t sure

How would conduct polixty without treasury market

Bush ram on tax cuts though Econ was strong

When elected passed big tax cuts

Got through w budget reconciliation which required sunset policies

Greenspan endorsed policy and said surpluses eventually would

Require

Govt to purchase

Private assets 

Was an odd comment as unlikely congress would

Have such large surpluses for an extended periods as

It did in 19th century

Greenspan was a republican and appeared political by endorsing fiscal policy

  

Bush passed more tax cuts after that and

Again after 911

Defense spending rose 15pct as well

While economy recovered from 2001 recession in terms of output,

Jobs didn’t recover till 2005

Uncertainty from 911 and Iraq

Bush was one of the most profligate presidents ever not paying for his tax cuts, multiple wars,

Or Medicare part D

As opposed to rest of entitlements there wasn’t a source of revenue for part D

Gore warned that the baby boomers retiring would put stress on entitlements by 2010

Excessive deficits obvs didn’t anticipate the GFC but were irresponsible nevertheless 

  

Fed gets blame for the housing crisis for not raising rates in 2002-2003 but that was because of the lack of job growth, partially due to the Iraq war

Fed funds was 1 during that period versus 2 pct inflation ie negative real rates 

They thought it could make sense to raise rates once

The risk

Of war had gone down 

Although house prices were rising,

Few thought there was a bubble till 2004 and

By then the fed was raising again 

  

Housing bubble Began before 2002 and continued after rates were increased

It was also present in countries like the UK w higher rates 

So bubble may have occurred even w higher rates


**Chapter 13 - The Financial Crisis and the Great Recession**

Bet Anne was an untested professor replacing a legend

Made sense that he projected continuing and conservatively hiked by 25 a few times

  

Even if bernanke wanted reforms to

Better monitor the financial system would be hard given his lack of market experience and since

His predecessor was revered and was against excess

Regulatio

  

After Bear shut down a fund and BNP gates a

Subprime

Find,

FOMC said was still concerned

W inflation which was 2.5

Wasn’t yet concerned w financial system

On 8/10

Changed tune and opened up lending facilities

Fed finally cut in sept 2007

After stability issues became

Clear

Bagehot was about supporting the economy not easing a liq crisis which may require different tools

By Jan 2008, the Fed realized they had to provide liquidity to the market and started aggressively cutting. 

  

When bear failed, the Fed agreed to take 30bn of risky assets on to its own BS that JPM wouldn’t take 

  

They also started offering more liquidity to primary dealers.

**Chapter 14 - All Together Now: The Fed and the Treasury Join Hands**

Bush passed a stimulus bill in feb 08 which was

1pct of

Gdp - direct transfers to taxpayers

  

Fed had already cut multiple times but it was too late 

Lehman followed by AIG, baml, GSEs,

WAMU, Wachovia etc

Led to tarp

For tarp,

Bernanke wanted to inject capital directly into banks

Usual playbook post banking crisis and would leverage governments money

  

Paulson was against the idea

As nationalizations would be called

Socialism by republicans and bailouts by democrats

Also believed would crowd out any private capital which they were still seeking

On these grounds he favored buying toxic assets 

  

When tarp was first pitched congress wasn’t as worried

As bernanke or Paulson

They thought this was a Wall Street issue

The bailouts for

Bear and AIG

Were also very unpopular 

  

 Ernanke was also against excess

Commitments from

The fed since he wasn’t elected 

  

Bernanke outlined a scary scenario where civil

Order could

Break down 

Congressional leadership agrees 

  

Kashkati made up the tarp numbers from

Thin air

**Chapter 15 - The Aftermath and the Backlash**

After tarp was eventually passed, Paulson changed his mind and thought bernankes plan made more sense. It was too hard to buy toxic assets. He didn’t tell congress this when they voted. The major banks were forced to take the capital injections. 

  

Wells Fargo tried saying no. Paulson told the CEO that the regulator would tell them

They’re

Undercapitalized. The generous terms of CPP (the capital program) while not helping homeowners angered the public.

  

McCain suspended his campaign for an emergency meeting he called over the economy. It backfired on him

As he looked erratic.

After Obama was elected in March dec 2008, Fed had to decide what to do next

Could cut rates further

Expand balance sheet

Give forward guidance (which was a new idea)

Ended up doing all 3

  

Unlike other banks didn’t take rates negative 

  

Dot plot didn’t start till 2012

  

A major money market fund was invested in Lehman CP which was worthless

Caused the breaking of the buck 

What was thought to be riskless

lost money 

  

Analogue to uninsured deposits?

  

Ppl pulled money from CP and MM 

Even blue chips were in danger of not making payroll due to reliance on market 

Fed program stabilized MM

  

This program - CPFF - was a turning point.

Fed actually bought corporate paper that market shunned

Saved the market by reassuring 

Was also a change in approach

Until

Then it seemed

Ad hoc -

Save Lehman but not bear - public didn’t understand guiding principles

This was first time

It was saving an actual market 

Next market it saved was ABS for student loans and others 

  

Also started QE1 - purchases of treasuries and MBS

MBS was a departure as they’re technically not riskless

Goal was to lower spread on MBS  which was accomplished

Qe2 got much more political push back though was less radical than qe1 and didn’t purchase any private assets may have made later rounds less

Activist 

  

Banking stress tests showed that biggest banks were okay

Marked end of banking crisis

Fed press conferences started w bernanke

  

Chap 15

  

Obama stimulus was completely opposed by republicans who claimed a negative multiplier 

Santelli’s rant gave rise to the tea party which contributed to 2010 midterm losses

Also opposed Obama tax cuts in stimulus bill which includes the poor who only paid payroll taxes

Despite tea party rhetoric polls showed public favored support for homeowners in trouble.. much more than for banks 

  

Unemployment was still high (10pct) and deficits were sharply higher so some concluded nothing was accomplished 

Keynesian models showed counterfactual would’ve been much worse

Even if you reject those models hard to say that 800bn created no jobs even if spent unwisely 

  

Midterm losses made future expansionsary policy in tough

  

2011-13 fiscal policy was contractionary

That was despite still high unemployment 

Fiscal austerity was offsetting monetary stimulus

Hard to run on the counter factual

Being worse

  

Dodd

Frank restricted the fed from

Lending to any specific entity -

Has to be broad based

And requires approval from treasury - section 13

Some thought this would restrict the Fed but treasury approves everything during Covid 

  

The feds actions post Lehman including QE grew the Feds balance sheet but didn’t increase m2

Ie the money supply 

That’s because paying interest on reserves which they started,

Broke the link bw the balance sheet and money supply

Banks were happy to hold on to reserves and not lend them out 

New regulatory requirements also required banks to

Hold more liquidity 

M2 did eventually grow at 7pct while inflation was much lower


**Chapter 16 - The Record Expansion of the 2010s**

In the 2010s,

Unemployment came down dramatically without rapid GDP growth 

This was due to low labour productivity

Fiscal policy contracted in 2012 partially due to election year

  

Bernanke announced that feds actions would come to an end as no longer needed ie tapering 

Marketed reacted strongly in 2013 - taper tantrum 

Partially why Fed gave lots ot notice in 2021

  

4tr of securities acquire through 3 rounds of QE

QE1 had a bigger impact on rates than qe2 which was more focused in term premia vs emergency lending 

Forward guidance and dot plots were bernankes attempt to increase transparency 

  

Obama may have wanted summers to replace bernanke as did most fed economists 

But

Feared could get ejected by banking committee s during confirmation

Left opposed him

  

FOMC finally raised rates when unemployment fell close to 5pct

They had been changing forward guidance esp relating to unemployment targets while saying policy stance hadn’t changed 

But dovish consensus was fraying - yelled had 3 dissents at previous meeting before raising 

  

During her tenure inflation edged above 2pct and unemployment fell close To 5

Raised rates 5 times 25 each - not much 

And started to shrink bs but not much 

  

Powell first fed chair in long time without Econ phd

Attacked by trump 

  



Chapter 17 - Trumpnomics before the Pandemic

Trumps tax cut similar to Johnson’s spending increase in 65 - stimulated an economy not in need 

Leading to inflation

Trump tax cut was supposed to improve wages by incentivizing business investment through tax cuts 

See Pettis

There was a marginal increase in ivestmwny but nowhere near the targets

  

Trump criticized yellen for keeping rates low saying it was political to help Clinton win

  

He later criticized Powell after the 2nd rate hike 

  

Fed later cut three times - partially due to trade war w China 

Trump asked for zero and negative rates

Was hard for Fed to cut without looking like caving to pressure 

All of the cuts had 2 dissents

  

On eve of pandemic and Econ was strong and very similar to Obama economy

Unemployment was low

Fiscal deficit was higher but most didn’t care

Rather bc of still low rates and foreign demand for treasuries many argued for higher deficits and debt

Rates were higher and so competing against loose fiscal but we’re still low 

  

Chapter 18 - Responding to the Great Pandemic

Fiscal had to do bulk of lifting during Covid bc nothing left for monetary to do

So even though monetary hadn’t been inflationary, the lack of bullets meant fiscal (which was inflationary) had to be used

  

Initial response was massive fiscal

Cares act was huge 10 pct of GDP

Due to uniform payments many ppl were getting more than from jobs

Stimulus maintained consumer spending and led to unprecedented savings rate

  

Republicans were against transfers to state and local government 

  

Monetary response

Fed was limited since policy rate was so low

Lower rates wouldn’t matter anyways when ppl are afraid to shop and leave their house

Treasury yields went negative due to excess demand for quality 

Had to create a new repo facility to maintain liquidity in treasuries

  

New lending facilities - pledged to buy treasuries and MBS

Support household credit 

Restarted GFC eta facilities to support commercial paper and asset backed securities

Created new facilities to support the corporate bond market, and municipals

Also to support bank lending to Main Street businesses

Fed had been able to buy munis but was restricted to short term, so new facility was a departure 

Barely used as existence calmed market

  

Main Street lending facility had very little take up as min loan size was $500k and banks had to retain 5pct

  

PPP was extended many times

Loans were non recourse to banks and backed by loans to small businesses which obviously had default risk and so were forgivable and most were

But we’re guaranteed by SBA

  

Fed made changes

Moved from 2pct to flexible inflation target and set wouldn’t take preemptive action on inflation but wait to see it 

Explicitly focused on employment and would look at broader measures than just u rate

Was also asymmetric and not worried about too much employment 

  

Bidens atimulus bill needed reconciliation to pass anyways and so he threw in some extras

Child tax credit was increased

Total value was 2tr - quarter more than cares act

Summers warned would create unprecedented inflation

  

Inflation started to rise in 2021 but Powell stuck to transitory and was still engaging in asset purchases 

  

By end of year he retired the term and started tapering purchases

Market didn’t respond like in 2013 as was well telegraphed and inflation worries were real

  

Biden pushed a couple more big spending bills but Manchin wasn’t willing to suppor


**Chapter 19 - Sixty Years of Monetary and Fiscal Policy: What's Changed?**

Monetary vs fiscal

Former mainly affects asset prices while the latter can be tailored to different groups

Kennedy was first to use fiscal policy to move aggregate demand, and did so without a recession

At the time Keynesian policy was supposed to be symmetrical and there were calls to use a surtax to cut inflation

Johnson resisted and it came too late,

Leading to inflation and birth of monetarism as Keynes was blamed for jnflatjon 

When surtax was enacted in 1968 was last time fiscal was used to cool the economy

Johnson loosened fiwscal policy for Vietnam and tried to fire head of Fed who was tightening monetary

Was first major conflict between fiscal and monetary 

Conflict died w Nixon and burns

Turned into stagflation with ford and the fed vascullatinf between fighting inflation and low growth

Monetary took the lead w Volker and as inflation became dominant worry

Reagan then boosted demand w tax cuts before switching to care about the deficit

Relied on the fed to manage demand while it focused on deficit

Fed may have pulled off a soft landing if not for first gulf war

No one considered fiscal policy for 1990-91 recession

Clinton ran on cutting deficits and was accommodated by Greenspan who raised rates slowly 

Business Investment as share of gdp rose during Clinton administration 

Bond market reacted strongly and rates fell - this offset the contractionary fiscal policy

Unemployment fell and inflation didn’t rise

Greenspan correctly attributed this to higher productivity due to the tech revolution which was underway - predicted this before most

And hence didn’t rates as quickly as some hoped

Greenspan became godlike and focus shifted away from fiscal 

  

Rose and fall of Keynesiaam is a recurring theme 

Budget deficits grew considerably after Reagan levels unthinkable to Eisenhower or Kennedy

Attitudes towards central bank independence have changed a lot since 1961

Fiscal came back w Obama and stimulus 

But after that republicans stopped any fiscal expansion after midterms 

Bernanke begged congress for help and worried c bank couldn’t do it alone 

Bc of zero bound in rates Fed thought it had a japan type problem and needed fiscal help

As that didn’t come, overall policy was contractionary 

  

Fiscal dominated in 1960s

Nixon dominated both 

Volker didn’t seek fiscal help

Regan and Clinton brought back fiscal in opposite ways 

They Focused on the budget and relied on monetary to manage economy 

This ended w GFC

  

Keynes 

Went in and out of fashion

Lost out to monetarism wh n Johnson delayed tax surcharge and got blamed for supply shock related inflation which was falsely attributed to money supply 

Even after Feds conversion to monetarism in 1970s gyrations in money supply and rates discredited the theory

K suffered from Clinton policies which focused on the deficit and argues for a negative multiplier 

Came to haunt in the future 

But Clinton cuts were backloaded and the real impact came from lowering long term rates

So growth came from increased credibility not fiscal cuts 

Neoclassical argues that markets clear instantly which most central bankers didn’t buy

Most policymakers became Keynes in crises

Trump followed same logic as bush w tax cuts after a period of austerity

Trumps promises even more optimistic

Bush 1 and Clinton were only ones who acted in truly anti Keynes fashion

The rest were either admitted Keynes or did so despite claiming the opposite

Deficits went from a moral outrage to something that crowed a out investment 

Regan attacked Carter for 2.5 deficit even though he grew it to 6.5

Start of pattern where R would attack deficits if D in power but celebrate them if R in power and brought via tax cuts 

Bush 1 was exception

Fiscal prudence ended in 2020 w 15pct deficits

R however objected to more spending when Biden came to power

  

Importance of Fed independence changed over time

Low point under Nixon 

Many prominent economists - Friedman and Tobin for ex were against it

Globally it wasn’t the norm 

Changed after inflation in 1970s when value of indep was clear

NZ was example

  

In 2008 given fees prominent role many looked to reign in C bank
