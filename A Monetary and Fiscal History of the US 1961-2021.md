Overview:

Binder describes the different approaches to fiscal and monetary policy taken by administrations and the Federal Reserve from the early 1960s through the Biden administration. He focuses on the interplay between budget actions and interest rates and how the economy responded. He also discusses how Keynesian approaches went in and out of favour.


Key Lessons/molecules:
- QE vs covid response - why one created inflation and other didn't
- Loose fiscal policy plus tighter (which had been the norm pre-2008 and will probably be again) leads to higher rates and decreases the share of GDP going to investment (fiscal deficits mean a share of spending goes to consumption)
- There was a time (not that long ago) when fiscal balances affected interest rates (e.g. Clinton's cuts bringing down the long-end)
- Regulation Q put a cap on rates and drove consumers out of deposits and into other instruments
- Johnson refused to pass a surtax because he thought it would make his war in Vietnam less popular. The ensuing inflation led to the rise of monetarism
- I don't understand monetarism that well - believed demand for money was inelastic. Under what conditions is that true?
- Friedman argued that the Phillips curve is vertical and unemployment is fixed at u-star. If unemployment goes below that level, it will push up inflation and inflation expectations. Firms wil raise prices before workers demand higher wages. The higher costs lower workers' real wages. Eventually they ask for higher wages, resulting to layoffs, bringing unemployment back to u-star. The rational expectations school argued against this outcome. 
- Supply shocks cause stagflation. Demand shocks cause prices and output to both increase (inflation). Supply shocks (oil embargo in the 1970s, covid shutdowns, etc) cause output and price to move in the opposite direction - stagflation. The phillips curve doesn't predict this. 
- The oil embargo also led to higher unemployment and not just lower wages. This was partially due to much lower worker productivity than expected. This was caused by businsses giving larger wage increases than warranted (as they didn't realize productivity decreased), and by policymakers targeting a higher level of growth (also not knowing that productivity decreased). These two factors raised NAIRU and led to policymakers targeting a lower level of unemployment than what was warranted. This led to inflation. What happened to worker productivity in the past few years?
- higher energy prices also meant firms used more labour which decreased productivity (assuming that's not the case anymore ?)
- lower labour productivity also shows up with a higher share of income going to labour. How does that connect with Pettis' argument? Higher deficits mean more consumption and more income to labour; does that imply lower productivity?







Notes:

**Chapter 1 - Fiscal Policy on the New Frontier**
Kennedy was the first president to use fiscal policy (a tax cut) to stimulate the economy when it wasn't in a recession. Following his assassination, Johnson continued expanding the budget with his war in Vietnam. He refused to rein in spending or increase taxes as it would make war less popular.

Loose fiscal policy plus tighter monetary (which is the norm) leads to higher rates and decreases the share of GDP going to investment. The budget deficits lead to more consumption and less savings.   

Regulation Q - a leftover policy from the Great Depression - put a cap on deposit rates. Based on the argument that part of the depression was caused by the ruinous competition for deposits. It has since been dismantled, but in the 1960s, it led to disintermediation when the fed rose rates. Depositors left banks for other instruments when market rates went above the cap. This hurt the housing sector as there less money to fund mortgages. This was before the government sponsored entities were created to stimulate the housing market. 
  
Under Bretton Woods, the USD was fixed against major currencies, and this restricted what the Fed could do. It couldn’t depreciate its exchange rate when inflation exceeded Germany's for example. Instead, gold would leave the country. This became a secular issue and eventually led to the end of the gold standard. 

Fed chair Martin was the longest serving chair of the Fed and like all previous heads, he had no formal Economics training. At the time most Fed chairs came from Wall Street. The head of the CEA was a Keynesian but also believed in contractionary policies when they were warranted. Johnson passed surtaxes (at the time, the Fed said contractionary policies should come from government not Fed). This eventually lowered growth but inflation continues to rise as unemployment was still below the natural rate.   


**Chapter 2 - Inflation and the Rise of Monetarism**

Monetarism emerged as a new economic theory based on the importance of the money supply. Monetarists, led by Friedman, argued the Fed should be affecting policy by targeting money supply. He argued fiscal deficits don’t matter if they're accompanied by bond issuance. This requires you to believe that demand for money is inelastic that is not dependent on rates - which many dispute (i.e. a vertical LM curve. See [[ISLM Model]] and [[Monetarism]]).

Due to the influence of monetarism, the Fed targeted and followed money aggregates. Greenspan ended the policy years later which had been a legal requirement. Friedman thought fiscal deficits were only inflationary if they were financed through printing money. His k% rule was monetary growth should equal gdp growth plus inflation. Monetarists argued that the Fed should target M (money supply) rather than r (interest rates). 

*Explanation through IS/LM model*
If M is fixed, you get an IS LM system where r and y will shift in response to changes in demand for money (LM shocks) or real spending (IS shocks). If r is fixed (i.e. a vertical LM curve), letting M fluctuate periodically to achieve the target r, LM shocks become irrelevant and only IS shocks matter. However,  they have a bigger impact than when upward sloping LM curve cushions impact. 

So targeting M avoids IS shocks but brings LM shocks , so depends on which you’re more worried about Poole argued we knew more about M than real incomes so should target M. This was proven wrong with various financial innovations, including those spurred by regulation Q. Many monetarists argued expanding money supply would lead to inflation. For example, QE in 2010, but it didn’t happen. The same argument was made post Covid, and it did happen that time. The difference was that with QE, the federal government wasn't increasing fiscal expenditures drastically (M2 didn't increase by nearly as much as post covid). Lower interest rates inflated asset prices but didn't put more money in people's pockets. That's what occurred in 2020. The increase in M2 was marginal in 2008 compared to 2020 when it quadrupled. 

Monetarism grew in popularity due to inflation in 1970s and 60s, and Keynesian policies were blamed. Monetarism fell out of favor as the velocity of money became more erratic.


**Chapter 3 - The Phillips Curve Becomes Vertical**

Keynesian thought in the 50s prior to the Phillips paper was crude and allowed only for inflation on or off regimes. After full employment, more demand (from fiscal or monterey policy) only increases inflation with no impact on output. The opposite was true before full employment - fiscal or monetary policy could only boost unemployment and wouldn't affect the price level. The Philips curve bridges the gap by giving menu of choices between unemployment and inflation. This led to a simplistic bifurcation between liberal and conservative economists.  

Friedman argued the curve was not taking into account inflation expectations, and in the long term the curve is vertical based on general equilibrium. If unemployment was below the natural rate u-star, that would push up inflation expectations and inflation. Businesses would realize this before workers and raise prices. Real wages would hence go down, and firms will hire even more people. Eventually workers will demand higher wages bringing up real wages and lower hiring which will bring unemployment back to u-star. So monetary policy won’t deviate unemployment from this natural rate, and the the Phillips curve is vertical. That is, unemployment is fixed at u-star. Inflation was up to policymakers. Eventually rational expectations theory went against some of the vertical curve arguments. 

**Chapter 4 - Nixon, Burns, and the Political Business Cycle**

Burns warned Nixon about a looming recession and argued for loosening of credit and increasing spending. The recession happened, and he lost to Kennedy. When Nixon became President later he appointed him to his cabinet. The country still had tight monetary and fiscal policy enacted by Johnson to combat inflation which worked, but it also created a short recession. Nixon in response called himself a Keynesian. Stimulus generally leads to real growth first, followed by inflation. Nixon goosed the economy with fiscal stimulus, including higher social security spending. It was also revealed post-Watergate that Burns was likely trying to help Nixon get reelected. His plan was to stimulate the economy with fiscal and monetary policy to get re-elected and then he'd deal with inflation. He enacted price controls soon after re-election. 

In 1973, Nixon unilaterally ended Bretton Woods by ending the convertibility to gold. The US had many years of gold outflows which led to this. Ending the fixed exchange rates removed monetary constraints for all who participated especially non-US countries who had to use monetary policy to maintain the fixed exchange rate. This was one of the causes of worldwide inflation that soon occurred. But inflation was a global issue, even for counties whose currency appreciated meaning there were other causes notably supply constraints. Although the US was less constrained by the system, the ending of Bretton Woods freed up the Fed as well.  

The Fed doubled the Fed Funds rate to 10% to fight inflation which had risen 400 bps. The Arab- Israeli war led to OPEC increasing oil prices and pushed the US into a recession. This was dubbed stagflation, and central banks didn’t know how to deal with it. They went back and forth from fighting inflation to trying to dampen the recession. The pre-election stimulus faded and gave way to a contractionary policy. It was clear that the cycle in 1971-73 was created politically. Price controls were seen as negative and were never attempted again. Political manipulation plus the backlash against price controls killed the political business cycle. Burns' manipulation is a key legacy of Nixon. Burns is remembered as someone who fanned inflation and aided Nixon's manipulation, although oil shocks were also to blame. Burns encouraged Nixon's use of price controls. His loose policies of early 1970s contributed to inflation even as he spoke out against inflation. He increased stimulus again in the late 1970s (1976-78); M1 and M2 increased by high single digits. He didn’t believe central banks could affect the inflation rate, and he told the senate banking committee as much. He blamed inflation on social democratic policies - the New Deal, Great Societies, etc. 

**Chapter 5 - Stagflation and Its Aftermath**

Stagflation was caused by supply shocks - oil prices from OPEC and food prices. Demand shocks cause prices and output to move in the same direction. Supply shocks cause the opposite; a negative correlation between inflation and growth i.e. stagflation. This was not well understood at the time, and it went against what the Philips curve predicted. Neoclassical economics predicted lower real wages but not higher unemployment due to these shocks. They also expected a lower hit to GDP. This discrepancy was due to wealth effect of a lower stock market (1972 and 1973 were the worst years ever in real terms), and a nominal tax system that was implicitly tightening, as it was taxing nominal gains. There were two other channels related to lower worker productivity:

1) Businesses didn’t realize productivity had gone down, and so they gave bigger real wage increases than warranted. This increased unit labour prices and caused inflation and higher unemployment.
  
2) Policymakers also didn’t realize this, and they targeted higher levels of growth leading to inflation. 

Both of these factors raised the actual NAIRU, and caused authorities to aim for a level of labour market tightness that’s inflationary. That is, the economy couldn't handle this level of full employment. Poor productivity, on its own, and due to the errors it led to, in monetary policy led to stagflation.

**Why did labour productivity decrease?**
 
You can see the lower productivity in labor's higher share of income. Friedman believed high relative prices i.e. oil prices shouldn’t cause inflation, as only higher money supply could cause that. 
Higher oil prices should lower other prices. In reality, higher relative prices cause inflation because other things don’t necessarily get cheaper due to rigidities, and an inflationary demand shock will change relative prices. That is, causality runs both ways when prices and wages are sticky. In response to an oil price shock, monetarists gave clear guidance to cut money supply. Keynesians had no obvious solution, as they said they couldn’t address inflation and the recession at the same time. 

It was possible to deal with the hit to demand with a combination of fiscal and monetary policies. Firms with large energy needs were forced to use more labour. This meant more labour costs for the same output and hence decreased labour productivity. The fed missed this and loosened more than they should’ve. Real wages also went too high by missing this and led to more nemployment. We may be seeing the same thing today with a return of union power.

**Chapter 6 - Inflation and the Rational Expectations Revolution**

Lucas led the revolution to rational expectations. President Carter appointed various business people to his cabinet. Carter's replacement for Burns didn’t know how the Fed worked. He was unable to pass fiscal stimulus due to congress' obsession with balanced budgets. He did pass new payroll tax credits which incentivized pay raises. It was a more efficient use of funds because it targeted marginal behavior versus actions that would happen anyways. Obama had something similar in the stimulus bill. Carter’s attempt at tax reform didn’t work. By the time it got through congress, it was just a big tax cut as big as the previous stimulus. Too much fiscal stimulus led to higher inflation. The dollar also weakened against German and Japan, as the world was still getting used to floating rates. President Carter sold gold and borrowed from the IMF for the first time. It also issued bonds in German marks and Swiss Francs for first and last time. Carter passed the law which gave the Fed the dual mandate. It's one of the few central banks to have employment mandate along with inflation. The Iranian revolution and its war with Iraq led to another supply shock. The oil component spiked 50pct. Monetarists still blamed inflation on money supply (because again, oil prices were relative and should cause other prices to fall) and because core inflation also rose a Lot. The latter could have occurred because supply shocks cause pass through into other components. Aggregate demand was up, however it was signaling too much stimulus from the prior period. The overstating of labour productivity may have been the cause. Fed chair Miller also deserves blame, as he didn’t think monetary policy was the primary cause of inflation. 
Unemployment was only 0.5pp below the natural rate at the time which shouldn’t have caused so much inflation.

**Question - how does labour productivity affect natural rate ?**

CPI  also overstated inflation by including nominal mortgage rates, so it caused a positive feedback loop.

**Chapter 7 - Carter, Volcker, and the Conquest of Inflation**

After his malaise speech, Carter appointed Volcker who was a known hawk and the head of the NY Fed. Carter knew he would tighten policy and possibly cost him reelection. Volcker thought he wouldn’t get the nomination when he told Carter he valued Fed independence and fighting inflation. You can contrast this with Nixon and Burns.  

Long end rates went up after Volcker appointment. That is, inflation expectations didn’t immediately come down which would have caused long end rates to fall. He announced a switch from a focus on Fed Funds to money supply. But due to regulations on rates and financial innovation, it was hard to reduce M1 initially. Fed funds also went up. Carter used an authority leftover from Nixon's time to impose credit constraints. He believed excess credit was the problem but the Fed disagreed. They imposed controls but had carveouts for houses or cars. Money supply growth dropped but so did GDP growth (8pct decline) and hence rates also fell. People cooperated with Carter and cut up credit cards.

**Chapter 8 - Reganomics and the Clash between Monetary and Fiscal Policy**

Carter's credit controls created a recession as did Volcker's tight money. Those two recessions ended inflation. They abandoned monetarism as it hadn’t worked and inflation was defeated. Volcker was an undersecretary under Nixon when bretton woods was abandoned. He was a supporter of fixed rates and so likely opposed the change.  

**Reagan**

His economic policy was shaped by supply side which was influenced by Laffer. The Laffer curve could raise Revenue by cutting taxes. There was never  any evidence that the US was on the right side of the curve. Republicans later denied he said that although the idea was repeated by Bush jr and Trump. Unlike Carter, Reagan blew up the budget. His expansionary fiscal policy was given credit for fixing the economy. But the recession and the breaking of inflation was already achieved via Volcker's tight policy which started a year earlier. During a debate, Regan asked whether you were better off from 4 yrs ago - real GDP per capita was actually up 8pct. But people felt poorer due to the prevoius recession and inflation. Reagan’s tax cuts created deficits which were unprecedented for peacetime. Tax cuts kicked in just as economy was recovering from the late 70s recession. Monetary policy also loosened by then. Tax cuts spurred economic growth from the demand side not supply. The growth rate in real terms for first term was about the same as during Carter's first term. So even after coming out of recession, growth was average. But the rate of growth was accelerating just as he went to reelection.   

Tight monetary policy should push up real rates and slow demand. Loose fiscal policy should also push up real rates but speed up demand. Putting them together should raise real rates; the effect on demand depends which is more powerful. Supply siders argued that they could spur growth with expansionary fiscal policies and simultaneously control inflation with tight monetary policy. Economist Mundell endorsed this idea, though it went against his previous work. In reality, real rates went up a lot which lowered the share of investment in the economy and pushed up the dollar (i.e., the savings deficit increased, causing the trade balance to increase). This hurt American exporters and led to the Plaza Accord where G5 countries agreed to let the dollar devalue. [[US Trade Policy]] 

Large budget deficits crowd out net exports along with investment. Budget deficits lead to more consumption and higher real rates. The latter deters investment which is necessary to build up an export base. The US trade deficit continued to grow. The legacy of Regan was Republicans no longer cared about deficits. They’ve been much larger post his presidency than before. They also seek to cut taxes regardless of the macro situation. Because republicans cut regardless, and then democrats have to try to reduce the deficit, the Fed has become responsible for stabilization since Regan.   



**Chapter 9 - The Long Expansion of the 1980s**

The "Great Moderation" was the period just after the early 80s recession. GDP volatility came down, and Regan passed tax reform which eliminated many tax shelters. Nominal and real rates declined steadily from 1981. The former was due to inflation expectations coming down, and the latter was due to more complex issues. The rise of China with its high savings rates and new technology requiring less investment. Nominal rates did briefly go up due to fiscal policy. Secretary Baker ordered Volcker not to raise rates but Volcker wasn’t planning to anyways. Regan appointees at the FOMC tried to cut the discount rate (out of the blue), but Volcker threatened to resign and so they retreated. Volcker didn’t want another term which was okay with Baker. They nominated Greenspan who was seen to be as political Burns was. 

**Savings and Loans Crisis**

Bank loans had long maturities, up to 30 years, and had short duration deposits. They hence sufferered losses when rates increased and inverted. Some banks made risky loans to cover losses. 
Depositors needed to be bailed out.

The Fed responded to Black Friday by saying they were available to supply liquidity to any banks (through the discount window) that needed it. Greenspan earned the market's trust. The Fed tightened in the late 1980s, and inflation moderated. Unemployment was thought to be below the natural rate, justifying the hike. Memories of the 1980s inflation wer still fresh. The First Gulf War spiked oil prices, and pushed the US into a short recession. The Fed was forced to raise rates due to the inflation spike, and then went back to cutting. The unemployment rate kept rising until 1992.

**Jobless Recovery** 

Bush blamed his failed reelection on Greespan, saying he wasn’t sufficiently expansive. The oil spiked caused a mini stagflation and the Fed knew that they couldn’t fight both simultaneously. 
They settled for a quick bout of inflation and then a quick recession. There wasn’t much on the fiscal front except for the previous tax reform. The preoccupation was then with cutting deficits.

**Chapter 10 - Deficits Crowd Out Fiscal Policy, 1982 - 1998**

Deficits crowd out private investment, but there’s no political incentive to eliminate them. Regan’s 
GRA law imposed mandatory budget cuts if deficit targets were not met. The law was ruled unconstitutional, and was overturned. It would've eliminated automatic stabilizers in a recession. Congress has limited control over the budget; it only controls annual appropriations and the eligibility for entitlements. Bush’s budget plan cleaned up the savings and loan mess and started the trek to a balanced buget, but he was punished for raising taxes. While he suffered politically, his counter cyclical paygo policies made sense.  

**Chapter 11 - The Long Boom of the 1990s**

**President Clinton**

Democrats pre-Regan were known as tax and spenders. This changed with Clinton, though he didn’t run on deficit reduction. He may have seen Perot’s success as evidence that the public cares about it since that was his whole campaign. Robert Rubin from GS cared about it as well. Lloyd Benson was getting messages from Greenspan who was also pushing it. Political advisors and Robert Reich were against too big of a cut. Even Reich was okay with cutting but didn’t want the 140bn of cuts. He wanted 120 - a small difference over 5 years. Clinton went for the bigger cuts, and the 30 yr went from 7.3 to 5.9. The deficit reduction was rear loaded. It made small cuts to social security - it made some Income taxable for upper earners. This was unusual for Democrats and hence made the plan seem credible to the market. Cutting fiscal deficits should lower rates which encourages investment and capital formation. That should improve productivity and real wages. Clinton wanted to sell the deficit reduction plan as a job creator not just the complex argument that it would improve real wages. The public was dealing with a jobless recovery and was  focused on jobs. 

The idea that fiscal cuts and tax raises could grow the economy even in the short term took hold though it made no sense. Rubin endorsed this negative multiplier theory arguing that it reduces the odds of something bad happening in the future. This "bad" thing could be a currency crisis which causes capital to flee and/or rising default risk which causes rates to spike and a recession. Those were all unlikely. The US wouldn’t default on own debt. The better argument was that if you can convince market debt won’t grow in future, that would lower rates today and create more investment. It still doesn’t meand there's a negative multiplier. Politicos learned the wrong lessons. deficit cuts won’t always lower yields. You have to be starting from high yields, have a period of irresponsible spending, and a change in government with new credible policies. Many became convinced that fiscal contraction was the key to the growing economy forgetting the special conditions that worked for Clinton. 

The Clinton boom actually started under Bush.  The 1991 recession was caused by the oil shock from the Iraq war. The public thought the economy was in decline even when it was growing under Bush. His party was mad about taxes. Bush blamed Greenspan for the recession. Secretary Brady tried to convince Greenspan and called FOMC members directly to no avail. Clinton was a beneficiary of the business cycle. 

Clinton got no  support from Republicans for deficit reduction, and only 50/57 democrats in the senate. He knew that Bush lost partially due to the Fed and was hoping it would cut as a reward for cutting the deficit. Greenspan didn’t commit to do so. Rubin knew that the Fed couldn’t do much more as Fed Funds were close to zero in real terms and it was up to bond market. The bond market came through and ensured deficit cuts weren’t contractionary.

Guided by Rubin, Clinton didn’t go to war with the Fed like Bush. The Fed increased rates 25bps, despite the deficit reduction, greatly angering Clinton. His advisors said real fed funds had been at zero for too long anyways, and if he criticized him publicly that would boost rates further and may cause fed to prove independence by raising more. They maintained a policy of not commenting on the Fed. The Fed kept hiking, raising rates from 3 to 6%.  At one point, the market was pricing in 8%. Greenspan was the first to issue forward guidance. The author thought Fed could be overdoing it, but the vice chair had never dissented before. Real rates went from 0 to 3 as inflation was flat. The 30 year went up 140 bps during the period. Unemployment was at 5.4 which was thought to be close to the natural rate. 

The rate was 5.5 when the 1998 recession caused by LTCM and the Russian default occurred. It cut 75 bps during this period, and Greenspan along with Rubin and summers were credited with saving the world. The boom of the late 1990s was driven more by cuts earlier in Clinton’s term than the smaller cuts in '97. The surplus increased without any change in policy. Many new jobs were created, and labour productivity increased a lot. As the economy was growing well in the late 90s, even dovish FOMC members like Yellen wanted to raise rates. Unlike in the past, Greenspan resisted. He predicted the productivity gains from technology and anticipated that the economy could handle more. Even as unemployment went down, there wasn’t any inflation.  

In 1990, central bank independence was rare. Only the US (kind of), Switzerland, and Germany had independent central banks. By the end of the decade, most developed and many developing countried had independent central banks. The success in fighting inflation, especially in Germany and Switzerland were the main motivators. A paper on time inconsistencies, which won Nobel prize, got too much credit for this. Few in policy circles knew about it.   

Fiscal policy was no longer used as a lever, and many stuck to the claim that a lower deficit stimulates the economy against Keynesian logic.



**Chapter 12 - The 2000s - The Job-loss Recovery and the Bubbles**

Gore ran as a fiscal conservative, and even said debt should be paid off by 2012, with entitlement spending put in a "lock box". Prior to the election, there were lots of debates for  what to do with surpluses. Fed wasn’t sure how it would conduct policy without a treasury market. Bush ran on tax cuts, even though the economy was strong. When he was elected, he passed big tax cuts which he got through with budget reconciliation which required sunset policies. Greenspan endorsed the policy. He said government surpluses should be decreased as they would eventually require the government to purchase private assets. That was an odd comment as it was unlikely that congress would have such large surpluses for extended periods as It did in the 19th century. Greenspan was a republican and appeared political by endorsing Bush's fiscal policy. Bush passed more tax cuts after that, and again after 911. Defense spending rose 15pct as well. While the economy recovered from the 2001 recession in terms of output, jobs didn’t recover until 2005, due to uncertainty from 911 and Iraq. 

Bush was one of the most profligate presidents ever. He didn't pay for his tax cuts, multiple wars, or Medicare part D. As opposed to the other entitlements ,there wasn’t a source of revenue for Medicare part D. Gore warned that the baby boomers' retiring would put stress on entitlements by 2010. Bush's excessive deficits obviously didn’t anticipate the GFC, but they were irresponsible nevertheless.  

The Fed gets blamed for the housing crisis, as it didn't raise rates in 2002-2003, but that was because of the lack of job growth, partially due to the Iraq war. Fed funds was 1% during that period versus 2% inflation, that is, real rates were negative. They thought it would make sense to raise rates once the risk of war had gone down. Although house prices were rising, few thought there was a bubble until 2004 and, by then, the Fed was raising again.  

The housing bubble began before 2002 and continued after rates were increased. It was also present in countries like the UK with higher rates. So a bubble may have occurred even with higher rates.


**Chapter 13 - The Financial Crisis and the Great Recession**

Bernanke was an untested professor replacing a legend. It made sense that he projected continuity  and conservatively hiked by 25 bps a few more times. Even if Bernanke wanted new regulations  to better monitor the financial system, it would have been hard, given his lack of market experience and since his predecessor was revered and was against excess regulation.   

Even after Bear Stearns shut down a fund and BNP gated a subprime fund, the FOMC said it was still concerned with inflation which was 2.5%. It wasn’t yet concerned with the financial system. 
On 8/10, it changed its tune and opened up lending facilities. The Fed finally cut in Sept 2007, after stability issues became clear. Bagehot's argument (that one should lend at high rates and only against good collateral) was about supporting the economy not easing a liquidity crisis which may require different tools. By Jan 2008, the Fed realized they had to provide liquidity to the market and started aggressively cutting. When Bear failed, the Fed agreed to take 30bn of risky assets on to its own BS that JPM wouldn’t take. They also started offering more liquidity to primary dealers.

**Chapter 14 - All Together Now: The Fed and the Treasury Join Hands**

Bush passed a stimulus bill in Feb 08 which was 1% of GDP - mainly direct transfers to taxpayers. The Fed had already cut multiple times but it was too late. Lehman followed by AIG, Merrill Lynch, the GSEs, WAMU, Wachovia etc.

**TARP**

Bernanke wanted to inject capital directly into banks. This was the usual playbook after a banking crisis and would leverage the government's money. Paulson was against the idea, as nationalizations would be called socialism by Republicans and bailouts by Democrats. He also believed that it would crowd out any private capital which they were still seeking. On these grounds he favored buying toxic assets rather than injecting capital. When TARP was first pitched, congress wasn’t as worried as Bernanke or Paulson. They thought this was a Wall Street issue. The bailouts for Bear Stearns and AIG were also very unpopular. Bernanke was also against excess commitments from the Fed since he wasn’t elected. Bernanke outlined a scary scenario where civil order could break down. Congressional leadership agreed to TARP. Kashkari made up the requested TARP allocation numbers from thin air.

**Chapter 15 - The Aftermath and the Backlash**

After TARP was eventually passed, Paulson changed his mind and thought Bernanke's plan made more sense. It was too hard to buy toxic assets. He didn’t tell congress this when they voted. The major banks were forced to take the capital injections. Wells Fargo tried saying no; Paulson told the CEO that the regulator would tell them they’re undercapitalized. The generous terms of CPP (the capital program), while not helping homeowners angered the public. 

McCain suspended his campaign for an emergency meeting he called over the economy. It backfired on him, as he looked erratic. After Obama was elected in Dec 2008, the Fed had to decide what to do next. It could cut rates further, expand the balance sheet, or give forward guidance (which was a new idea). It ended up doing all 3. Unlike other central banks, it didn’t take rates negative. The dot plot didn’t start until 2012.   

A major money market fund was invested in Lehman CP which was worthless. This caused the "breaking of the buck". What was thought to be riskless, lost money. This is a good analogue to uninsured deposits crisis happening now. People pulled money from CP and MM. Even blue chips were in danger of not making payroll due to their reliance on this market. The Fed program stabilized MM; this program, CPFF, was a turning point. The Fed actually bought corporate paper that the market shunned and reassured the market. It waas also a change in approach. Until then, everthing seemed ad hoc. Saving Lehman but not Bear. The public didn’t understand the guiding principles. This was the first time it was saving an actual market. The next market it saved was ABS for student loans and others. 

It also started QE1 - the purchases of treasuries and MBS. MBS was a departure as they’re technically not riskless. The goal was to lower the spread on MBS which was accomplished. QE2 got much more political push back even though it was less radical than QE1 and it didn’t purchase any private assets. That may have made later rounds less activist. Banking stress tests showed that biggest banks were okay, and this marked end of the banking crisis. 


The Fed press conferences actually started with Bernanke. The Obama stimulus plan was completely opposed by Republicans who claimed it would have a negative multiplier. Santelli’s rant gave rise to the tea party which contributed to Obama's 2010 midterm losses. They also opposed Obama's tax cuts in the stimulus bill, as they included the poor who only paid payroll taxes. Despite tea party rhetoric, polls showed the public favored support for homeowners in trouble-- much more than for banks.  

Unemployment was still high (10pct) and deficits were sharply higher, so some concluded that nothing was accomplished by the stimulus bill. Keynesian models showed that the counterfactual would’ve been much worse. Even if you reject those models, it's hard to say that 800bn created no jobs even if it was spent unwisely. Midterm losses made future expansionsary policy tough. 2011-13 fiscal policy was contractionary, and that was despite still high unemployment. Fiscal austerity was offsetting monetary stimulus.
 
Dodd-Frank restricted the Fed from lending to any specific entity. It had to be broad based and required approval from the Treasury - section 13. Some thought this would restrict the Fed but the Treasury approved everything during Covid. The Fed's actions post Lehman including QE grew the Feds balance sheet but didn’t increase M2, Ie the money supply. That’s because the Fed started paying interest on reserves. This broke the link between the balance sheet and money supply. That is, banks didn't have to increase lending and create new deposits. They lost their treasuries but gained reserves. Banks were happy to hold on to reserves and not lend them out.  

New regulatory requirements also required banks to hold more liquidity. M2 did eventually grow at 7pct while inflation was much lower. Compare this to what happened with covid.


**Chapter 16 - The Record Expansion of the 2010s**

In the 2010s, unemployment came down dramatically without rapid GDP growth. This was due to low labour productivity. Fiscal policy contracted in 2012 partially due to the election year. Bernanke announced that the Fed's actions would come to an end as it was no longer needed i.e. tapering. The market reacted strongly in 2013 - the taper tantrum. This was partially why Fed gave lots of notice in 2021. Four tr of securities were acquired through 3 rounds of QE. QE1 had a bigger impact on rates than Qe2 which was more focused in term premia vs emergency lending. Forward guidance and dot plots were Bernanke's attempt to increase transparency.

Obama may have wanted Summers to replace Bernanke as did most Fed economists. But he feared Summers could get rejected by the banking committees during confirmation. The Left opposed him. The FOMC finally raised rates when unemployment fell close to 5pct. They had been changing forward guidance esp relating to unemployment targets while saying the policy stance hadn’t changed. But the dovish consensus was fraying; Yellen had 3 dissents at the previous meeting before raising. During her tenure, inflation edged above 2pct and unemployment fell close To 5pct. She raised rates 5 times 25 each - nothing extraordinary. She started to shrink the BS but not by too much.  

Powell was the first Fed chair in a long time without Econ Phd. 

Chapter 17 - Trumpnomics before the Pandemic

Trump's tax cut was similar to Johnson’s spending increase in 65. It stimulated an economy not in need, leading to inflation. The Trump tax cut was supposed to improve wages by incentivizing business investment through tax cuts. [[US Trade Policy]] 

There was a marginal increase in investment, but it was nowhere near the targets. Trump criticized Yellen for keeping rates low, saying it was political decison to help Clinton win. He later criticized Powell after the 2nd rate hike. The Fed later cut three times, partially due to the trade war with China. Trump asked for zero and negative rates. It was hard for the Fed to cut without looking like it was caving to pressure. All of the cuts had 2 dissents. On the eve of the pandemic, the economy was strong and very similar to Obama's economy. Unemployment was low;  the fiscal deficit was higher but most didn’t care. Rather, because of still low rates and foreign demand for treasuries, many argued for higher deficits and debt. Rates were marginally higher and so were competing against a loose fiscal policy.  

Chapter 18 - Responding to the Great Pandemic

Fiscal policy had to do the bulk of lifting during Covid because there wasn't anything left for monetary policy. So even though monetary policy hadn’t been inflationary, the lack of bullets meant fiscal policy (which would be inflationary) had to be used. The initial response was massive fiscal policy. The Cares Act was huge - 10 pct of GDP. Due to uniform fiscal transfers,  many people were getting more than from jobs. The stimulus maintained consumer spending and led to an unprecedented savings rate. Republicans were against transfers to state and local governments.  

**Monetary response**

The Fed was limited since the policy rate was so low. Lower rates wouldn’t matter anyways when people were  afraid to shop and leave their house. Treasury yields went negative due to excess demand for quality assets. The Fed had to create a new repo facility to maintain liquidity in treasuries. New lending facilities were created and pledged to buy treasuries and MBS and support household credit. They restarted GFC era facilities to support commercial paper and asset backed securities. They created new facilities to support the corporate and municipals bond market. They also decided to support bank lending to Main Street businesses. The Fed had been able to buy munis, but it was restricted to short term, so the new facility was a departure. It was barely used as its existence calmed the market. 

The Main Street lending facility had very little take up as the minimum loan size was $500k and banks had to retain 5%. The PPP was extended many times. Loans were non-recourse to banks and backed by loans to small businesses which obviously had default risk and so were forgivable. Most were guaranteed by the SBA. 

The Fed made changes its near-term goals. It moved from 2% to a flexible inflation target and said it wouldn’t take preemptive action on inflation but wait to see it. It explicitly focused on employment and would look at broader measures than just the unemployment rate. It was also asymmetric and not worried about too much employment. Biden's stimulus bill needed reconciliation to pass anyways and so he threw in some extras, such as an increased Child Tax Credit. Its total value was 2tr - a quarter more than the Cares Act. Larry Summers warned it would create unprecedented inflation.  

Inflation started to rise in 2021, but Powell stuck to the transitory narrative and was still engaging in asset purchases. By end of the year, he retired the term and started tapering purchases. The market didn’t respond like in 2013 as it was well telegraphed and inflation worries were real. Biden pushed a couple more big spending bills but Manchin wasn’t willing to support them. 


**Chapter 19 - Sixty Years of Monetary and Fiscal Policy: What's Changed?**

**Monetary vs Fiscal**

Monetary policy mainly affects asset prices while fiscal policy can be tailored to different groups. President Kennedy was the first to use fiscal policy to move aggregate demand and did so without a recession. At the time, Keynesian policy was supposed to be symmetrical, and there were calls to use a surtax to cut inflation. President Johnson resisted and it came too late, leading to inflation and the birth of monetarism as Keynes was blamed for inflation. When the surtax was enacted in 1968, it was the last time fiscal policy was used to cool the economy.

Johnson loosened fiscal policy for the Vietnam War and tried to fire the head of the Fed who was tightening monetary policy. This was the first major conflict between fiscal and monetary policy. The conflict died with Nixon and Burns. It turned into stagflation with Ford and the Fed vascillated between fighting inflation and low growth. 

Monetary took the lead with Volcker, and as inflation became the dominant worry, Reagan  boosted demand with tax cuts before switching to care about the deficit. He relied on the Fed to manage demand while he focused on the deficit. The Fed may have pulled off a soft landing if not for first gulf war. No one considered fiscal policy for dealing with the 1990-91 recession. 

Clinton ran on cutting deficits and was accommodated by Greenspan who raised rates slowly. 
Business Investment as a share of GDP rose during the Clinton administration. The bond market reacted strongly and rates fell. This offset the contractionary fiscal policy. Unemployment fell and inflation didn’t rise. Greenspan correctly attributed this to higher productivity, due to the tech revolution which was underway. He predicted this before most people, and hence didn’t rates as quickly as some hoped. Greenspan became godlike and the focus shifted away from fiscal policy. 
  
Budget deficits grew considerably after Reagan to levels unthinkable to Eisenhower or Kennedy. Attitudes towards central bank independence have changed a lot since 1961. Fiscal policy came back with Obama and the stimulus plan. But after that, Republicans stopped any fiscal expansion after midterms. Bernanke begged congress for help and worried that the Fed couldn’t do it alone. 

Because of the zero bound in rates, the Fed thought it had a Japan type problem and needed fiscal help. As that didn’t come, overall policy was contractionary.  

Fiscal dominated in the 1960s. Nixon dominated both fiscal and monetary. Volcker didn’t seek fiscal help, and Regan and Clinton brought back fiscal in opposite ways. They focused on the budget and relied on monetary to manage the economy. This ended with the GFC.  

**Keynes** 

Went in and out of fashion. It lost out to monetarism when Johnson delayed the tax surcharge and got blamed for the supply shock related inflation which was falsely attributed to money supply. Even after the Fed's conversion to monetarism in the 1970s, gyrations in money supply and rates discredited the theory. Keynes suffered from Clinton's policies which focused on the deficit and argued for a negative multiplier. But Clinton's cuts were backloaded, and the real impact came from lowering long term rates. So growth came from increased credibility not fiscal cuts. 

Neoclassical economics argues that markets clear instantly which most central bankers didn’t buy. 
Most policymakers became Keynesians in crises. Trump followed the same logic as Bush with tax cuts after a period of austerity. Trump's promises were even more optimistic. Bush 1 and Clinton were the only ones who acted in truly anti-Keynes fashion. The rest were either admitted Keynes supporters or did so despite claiming the opposite.

Deficits went from a moral outrage to something that crowded out investment. Regan attacked Carter for a 2.5% deficit even though he grew it to 6.5%. This was the start of a pattern where Republicans would attack deficits if Democrats were in power but celebrate them if Republicans were in power and raised them via tax cuts. Bush 1 was the exception.

Fiscal prudence ended in 2020 with a 15% deficit. Repblicans however objected to more spending when Biden came to power.   

**Importance of Fed independence changed over time**

The low point was under Nixon. Many prominent economists - Friedman and Tobin, for example were against it. Globally it wasn’t the norm. This changed after the inflation of the 1970s when the value of independence became clear. New Zealand was the example for many. In 2008, given the  Fed's prominent role, many looked to reign it in.
