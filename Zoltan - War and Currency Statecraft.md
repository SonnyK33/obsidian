The world is splitting into the G7+Australia and the BRICS+. The latter includes the original BRICS plus Indonesia, Mexico, UAE, Saudi Arabia, and possibly South Korea, Thailand, Senegal and others. The BRICS is attempting to displace the dollar as the settler of cross-border transactions. Many members are already settling trade in their own currency (e.g. India, UAE, and Russia/China). The west's sanctions agains Russia was the latest catalyst for this, but it's been a long-time coming.

China is setting up a network of central bank swap lines much like the US. While the US ones were put in place to support portfolio hedging, the Chinese ones aim to support trade. 

Central bank digital currencies are making it easier for EM's to move away from the USD. China is trying to build a system with CIPS to rival CHIPS/Fedwire/SWIFT which will work with BRIC central banks to connect countries directly. Rather someone converting HUF->EUR->USD->SGD, they may be able to directly go from HUF->SGD. 

Indonesia and Mexico want to setup some kind of litium OPEC and SK was snubbed by AUKUS and is stuck between the US and China.
