[[Currency and Hegemony]]


The CFA franc was born from the colonial franc which was accepted throughout the empire. In 1945, the franc was devalued globally but not uniformly. It was kept artificially high in the colonies which made their exports uncompetitive. The franc also allowed France to buy resources from the colonies without needing dollars which was becoming the reserve currency. In the 1960s, most French speaking countries in Africa were given independence but still had to use the franc. Most of the leaders were trained in France and were part of the elite. Guinea refused to sign and was made an example of by Degaulle who pillaged the country as they left. 

The current CFA has two zones in West and central Africa. There is a fixed exchange rate with the euro that hasn’t changed since 1999. The French treasury gets a 50pct cut on any conversions from the Franc (that go through the EUR I assume).

There are 4 pillars to the current regime

- Fixed rate 
- The 50pct cut is the freedom of convertibility (not sure on the 50%)
	- It’s for when access to Euros is needed
	- Allows France to buy whatever they want from the colonies on credit 
- There’s a freedom of repatriation from the colonies 
- fourth?
  

The monetary union leads to low inflation and attracts foreign investors - ie the French. This creates a vicious circle where the supposed benefits of French investment are used to justify the continuation of the union. The French frequently intervened and supported coups against leaders who wanted to move away from the system - Burkina Faso for example.

The French claim they guarantee countries’ Euro obligations, but there are strict requirements for minimum FX reserves anyways. Even French companies prefer to invest in other African countries as they have better growth prospects.
