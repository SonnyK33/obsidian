**2023 Election**
The Labour Party has the most to gain from the you vote in the upcoming election. 

2023 Monetary policy
People calling for new central bank to increase rates to attract more flows into local securities. Is that really the best policy? Won’t that increase carry trade flows. They need to stop defending the Naira or else decide against open capital flows.
Also, the firing of the former head of the central bank doesn’t seem legal. The president needs 2/3’s of the senate. He was also arrested.
