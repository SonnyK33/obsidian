2023 Monetary policy

Monetary policy could go in 3 different directions:

1) maintain peg and current/capital account restrictions

2) peg + liberalize capital and current accounts

3) floating + liberalize

  
If they choose 2 (current situation) the rate is moot ("non-binding"), as investors could borrow in Naira and lend abroad if rates are too low. There wouldn't be exchange rate risk if the currency is pegged. An example of the impossible trinity. The central bank would be using the exchange rate rather than inflation as the anchor. The risk here is that it turns into Turkey and encourages a carry trade to develop.

Capital account restrictions have made it difficult to pay out dividends which has been an impediment to investment.

People calling for new central bank to increase rates to attract more flows into local securities. Is that really the best policy? Won’t that increase carry trade flows. They need to stop defending the Naira or else decide against open capital flows.
Also, the firing of the former head of the central bank doesn’t seem legal. The president needs 2/3’s of the senate. He was also arrested.
