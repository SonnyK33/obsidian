A review of a new biography of Kennan by Frank Costogiola. Kennan was famous for writing the anonymous article on Foreign Affairs warning about the imminent rivalry between the US and the Soviet Union. However he quickly became critical of the US’ unwillingness to negotiate and its intense militarization. He agreed with a criticism by Lippman that the Soviets were defensive in nature and didn’t want to invade anyone. He had a fascination with pre-revolutionary Russia. He didn’t see the Cold War as inevitable.

Some of what he wrote could be useful for thinking about US vs China.
