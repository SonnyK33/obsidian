Leading up to the GFC, many imbalances developed. The strong demand for safe assets allowed the US to run large fiscal deficits. This large payment imbalance has come back, The US, UK, and Eurozone all run large CA deficits. Japan's surplus came from its offshore investment earnings. Those have also decreased. Japan's position has worsened since 2007 as it used to benefit from nuclear power anbd coal. Oil imports have hurt its trade balance. These have been matched by large surpluses in the oil exporters (Russia, Saudi, and rest of GCC) and in China. A few US allies also run large surpluses (Norway, Switzerland, Ireland, Singapore, and Taiwan).

The trade balances don't fit with the friend-shoring argument. The US can't only trade with its allies, and nor can its "adversaries". Geopolitical Alpha argues the same thing. US allies will compete amongst each other to trade with China. 

What's different from 2007, is non-allies aren't building reserves. Russia can't, Saudi is investing through its SWF, and China is accumulating other assets (offshore accounts, maybe gold?). Withdrawal of foreign investors from China's bond market has offset some of the missing reserves. Treasury issuance now far exceeds central bank demand. Private banks will have to absorb the added duration. It also means troubled states can easily get bailouts from the surplus holders. Russia has no need for its reserves and so can give them to Turkey. Saudi has similarly bailed out Pakistan. This means a diminishing role for the IMF/WB.
