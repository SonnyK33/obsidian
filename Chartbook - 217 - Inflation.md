Service inflation has increased in the US, while the terms of trade shock hit Europe harder as it imports energy. US covid aid was more generous but contracted sharply; in Europe it’s stayed expansionary with the Ukraine war. S GDP has also grown while Europe has been stagnant since 2019; US grew due to surge in private consumption, esp in goods. US LFP has remained low, with young and older workers not returning. Wages haven’t kept up with prices so far; so more wage inflation coming, especially in Europe. In the US, most good inflation is coming from wage inflation.

Beveridge curves show relationship between vacancy rates and unemployment. You’d expect higher unemployment to be associated with lower vacancy rates. f whole curve moves outward over time, the economy is becoming less efficient, as the same level of vacancy is associated with higher and higher unemployment, i.e. there's a mismatch in skills. Put another way, 4% unemployment in 2001-08 matched with 3% vacancy rate; today it’s 7%. Netherlands is a good bellwether for EU given surging wage inflation.
