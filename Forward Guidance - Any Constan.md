Andy sees 3 scenarios - a soft landing, a hard landing, or a "higher for longer" environment. He's short equities and bonds, as he thinks one will win, or possibly both. The exception is the "higher for longer" case when equities benefit from a loosening unemployment environment and higher nominal sales. He's hedging that scenario b being long June SOFR and short DEC contracts, to benefit from fewer cuts than the market is expecting. The current spread (190 bps).

Market is pricing probability of soft landing at 30% which seems high. He's short gold as he thinks all of the monetary tightening goes against the debasement theme. He's short oil as doesn't think it will do good in a recessionary environment. It work as a hedge for the higher for longer or soft landing scenarios though.
