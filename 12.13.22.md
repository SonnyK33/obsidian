Today was CPI day and it came in below expectations. The market was expecting this and it rallied 1%+ yesterday. When the data came up, markets gapped up >2%. As of 12:30pm however, it's only up 0.4%.
Gold is up 1.5%, oil is up 3%+ and the long bond is up 1.4%.

The market is clearly pricing in a mild recession and a pivot. Gold is up as people expect real rates to decrease as the fed stops fighting inflation. Oil is up on OPEC cuts, Russian sanctions, and the China reopening. Long bond is up on rate cuts next year.
