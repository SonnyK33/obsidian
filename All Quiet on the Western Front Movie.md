The start of movie reminds me of the beginning of **Deer Hunter**, where the main characters are so excited to be deployed. Young men swept up with nationalism and the excitement of war. In this movie the new soldiers take the uniforms of fallen comrades. In DH, the old soldier comes home and is dead inside.

A key theme of the movie is the sheer pointlessness of war. The Germans knew they had to surrender but continued sacrificing their soldiers for pride. The contrast between the luxury train and trench warfare is very stark. The saddest part of the movie to me was when the  main character kills the French soldier and is instantly mortified with what he's done. They have no idea why they’re fighting and don’t care - they see it as an instrument of the rich (the pigs). Also noteworthy is that when they’re negotiating peace, the Germans warn of an unhappy peace which the French don’t care about. This foreshadows the rise of Nazism in Germany and eventually WW2. You have to care about the median voter, even among your enemies.
