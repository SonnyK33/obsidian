[[A man's fate - WIP]]

This is from a collection of Sartre's short stories. I saw a lot of parallels with [[A man's fate - WIP]].

Theory versus practice is a dominant theme. In the end, it’s what’s effective that matters. Existentialism is about doing what feels right rather than trying to fit rigid principles. Even when you think you’re being high minded, others can fail you. You end up the loser in the end.

Ivan is insecure and is trying to prove something to his wife and to his comrades. He joined the communist cause out of principles, not necessity. Those who joined out of poverty are quick to make compromises when necessary. Ivan resents this, possibly because he doesn't understand it. He can't relate to those who joined the cause in order to survive. But he isn't as high minded as he acts; he was easily lured by Roeder's charm and persuaded not to kill him. He shot him out of pure jealousy, as he caught him with his wife. The compromises that Roeder wanted to make were eventually accepted by the party, and the real reason he was killed (which was hidden for the cause) was made public. Ivan killed Roder for the wrong reasons, but ironically, that became the right reason for the party. 

I'm not sure who I agree with more. There are parallels to today's conflicts between liberals (Ivan) and leftists (the party). I have a hard time understanding those who compromise on principles so easily. But maybe I just don't understand their situation. Those who are bound by necessity don't always stick to principles. For instance, it's easy to be against "law and order" type policies when you're affluent and live in safe neighborhoods. Even if you're motivated by principles, it's wrong to look down on those who live in poor neighborhoods and have to deal with crime on a daily basis. The roots of that crime may be complex, but that doesn't matter to the people who have to go through it. Existentialism means to appreciate these nuances. 


The main character, Ivan, was just released from prison and goes to meet his comrade Olga. Party officials soon arrive to kill Hugo. Perhaps they worried he talked in prison? They see him as a poser - a bourgeois intellectual and anarchist. He isn’t reliable. He went to jail for killing someone, which were the party orders. But there’s some ambiguity if he killed him for the right reasons. It’s clear that party loyalty is the most important factor thing to Olga. She’s all about following orders. Hugo says that getting orders is fine, but when you carry them out you’re on your own. You can see the existenialist links here, and connections with other stories in the same anthology. 
 
Olga saves him from the party members. She says they owe him something, but to them, discipline is everything. He now reveals the truth as to why he went to prison.   

**The flashback**
Ivan is looking for real work. He’s trying to break from his image of an intellectual anarchist. He convinces Louis that he should be in charge of assassinating Roeder who is looking for a compromise between their party and the  fascists. He gets a jobs as Roeder’s secretary due to having a wife. Roeder didn’t want the secretary to be distracted by other women.

His wife is attractive and seems involved in party politics as well. Ivan is trying to impress her. They both move in with Roeder. Roeder's bodyguards don’t respect him because he didn’t join the party out of hunger but the desire for self respect. That’s what’s he’s really in search of. He’s really trying to impress his wife. 

Hugo and Roeder get into a long debate over theory and practice. Roeder wants to compromise with the fascists in order to govern. Hugo is committed to his principles over governing. He’s an intellectual who feels insecure.

He goes to kill Roeder but backs off last minute. Hoeder calls his bluff and tells him he’s not a killer. He offers to take him under his wing and guide him. Hugo seems to agree and leaves. He then comes back and sees Hoeder kissing his wife and he kills him. He fulfilled the mission but for the wrong reason.   

Flash forward to the future and Olga tells him that Roeder has actually been rehabilitated. They now agree with his plan (to reconcile with the fascists). As a consequence, they have to go with the the lie (actually the truth) that he was killed over a woman. This enrages Hugo who refuses to go along with the plan.

He convinced himself that he killed Roeder for the right reasons. He killed him because he abandoned his principles and lied to the people. But the party was now doing the same thing. Everyone is in on the lie and has dirty hands.
