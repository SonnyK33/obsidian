The VIX today is calculated based on variance swaps and is a weighted average of all outstanding OTM options. VIX spot would be an ideal hedge but it can’t be bought. VIX futures aren’t a long term strategy as the curve is mostly in contango.

Because VIX is based on variance swaps it is the square of volatility and offers convex payoffs relative to realized vol. Because of that VIX should trade at a premium to ATM vol. There’s an intrinsic level that Vix futures can go vs spot SPX vol. Beyond that level you’re being paid to take a convex bet. ATM option IV is best guess for short term RV, and a Variance swap should be that value plus a premium because it has a squared exposure. If you short vol via shorting a variance swap so you lose more than if you're short the implied vol and so you have to be paid for that risk. For example, if atm vol is 20, variance swap could be 23



**VIX Trades**

*Long vol + rolling down forward curve*
Short Vix futures + over buying ATM calls at 1.5x ratio to start delta neutral. If vol falls, you benefit from short position and net negative delta. If vol rises, delta rises and you get convex payouts.

*Generates yield w capped short Vega trades*
Selling call spreads on VIX or put spreads on equities in order to fund long gamma trades - long 5 delta puts or calls.

*Short VIX vs short S&P*
When Vix in contango, Short front month Vix for roll yield and short S&P to hedge for changes in overall vol. The opposite trade when curve is inverted. The risk is sudden VIX spike, though you normally have a warning due to vol clustering. Sometimes you benefit when vix goes up and stocks go up or the opposite 
  
*Calendar spread* 
Long front month to be long vol but financed w short future month (which gives roll yield) 
Doing this intraday is more capital efficient as most margin requirements are overnight
