11.1.22 Podcast - Forward Guidance (Nicky T, Fed Guy)
[[Powell]] won't pivot as he would rather front-load rate increases, as doing so next year if the inflation problem continues, would be much harder. Inflation hasn't come down and unemployment is still low. Savings balances (even among middle class) are still above where they were pre-pandemic. Wages are still going up by more than 2%, and so consumers can still afford 2% inflation. Wages and savings need to come down to the point, that consumers can't afford the inflation. BoE and BoC have stronger transmission mechanisms due to the variable rate mortgages. Fed increases have frozen the housing market but haven't hit consumers yet. 
Powell wants the policy rate to be the standard policy tool (not balance sheet reductions). He doesn't want to be known as Arthur Burns who is still remembered as the guy who let inflation run. Politics is about to get much tougher; while Volker is revered now, he was attacked for fighting inflation in the 1980s.
