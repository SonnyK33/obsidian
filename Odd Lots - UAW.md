There's a lot of new leadership at unions. They got radicalized when they were deemed essential and not replaceable during the pandemic. Younger members are especially radical. For autos there’s tension between the administration's push for EVs and the labour movement. They're focused on tiering which came into practice in 2009. It promises lower wages for some people in perpetuity depending on when they joined. 
Subsidies for EV plants haven’t required union membership and have resulted in investments in right to work states. The union knows Biden needs them and it’s an election year. New union leadership is militant.
