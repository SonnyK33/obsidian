In economics, you should use differential rather than difference equations.

The different schools of economic thought:

1) Physiocratic- wealth comes from the soil
2) Classical - Adam smith - comes from labour
He saw value in manufacturing while physiocratic thought that was just changing the form.
3) Marx - criticized capitalism 
4) Neoclassical - defended capitalism
Equilibrium - marginal cost equals marginal utility .
It had a subjective view on value and ignores money. The value is based on utility. 
Classical didn’t talk about utility and focused on average cost.

Schumpeter and post Keynesians believe in capitalism's disequilibrium. Entrepreneurial and capitalists take advantage of the disequilibrium or arb opportunities. Schumpeter believed in power and role of money to incent entrepreneurs. Austrians focused on hard money. MMT is accounting and focuses on double entry accounting, which is needed if money is treated as credit and not hard money. It sees money as product of social relations. Marginal prices don’t play a role in setting exchange rates in Marxism. In neoclassical, the ratio of marginal costs equals ratio of marginal utility. Marx says that’s the starting point but eventually each side realizes how much labour goes into their product, and it’s produced simply to get the highest price.  

Marx measures utility objectively, i.e. a chair is for sitting. Neoclassical measures it based on what persons desire, e.g. how comfy is the chair. Marx argued that factories produce goods that have no utility unless they’re sold for a profit. Only labour has surplus value, and it was the only commodity with this characteristic. Marx thought only labour had surplus value and not machinery i.e. that machines would cost as much as value they can create. Hence as firms use more machinery profit will fall and as labour is only source for profits. This will lead to workers revolutionizing but he later acknowledged that machines could also produce surplus value as can generate revenue exceeding depreciation which contradicted his own theory for revolution.

Marx thought revolution would come to U.K. first and thought needed to go through capitalism before socialism which is what Mensheviks thought. Bolsheviks thought could go straight to socialism. Socialism failed in Russia because it had no need to innovate. They could first rely on a large pool of unemployed people, but when that ran out, growth couldn’t exceed pop growth. Keen thinks socialism as practiced in the Soviet Union leads to Stalinism because the lack of available goods made people unhappy and so they need to be repressed.

Godley tables were used by Minsky. They uses double entry accounting to model complex systems. Marx tried to learn calculus to model his theory. The American economist Goodwin tried to complete for him. Neoclassical economists argue that credit doesn’t affect demand. Loanable fund model says one persons credit is another’s debit so credit doesn’t affect demand overall. But banks create money when they lend. Some Austrian town during the Great Depression attempted to stimulate demand by creating its own currency and depreciating it. People then had to use it money quickly and it cut unemployment. The Austrian government found this out and shut it down. The danger is debt deflation where margin calls force liquidation which forces deflation. As prices go down debt goes up in real terms. This is caused by too much private debt; 30-70pct of GDP is moderate.
