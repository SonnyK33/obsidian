This book describes a period shortly after the Mexican Revolution, when the Catholic Church was persecuted and outlawed. The police were closing churches and hunting down priests. The story follows Jose, a "whiskey priest" on the run. He got that name from his penchant for breaking the rules-- drinking alcohol, and in his case, fathering a child with a member of the Parish. 

Most of the story depicts Jose on the run, attempting to evade the Lieutenant. His faith is constantly challenged, especially as he refuses to repent for having a child. The police and the political forces they represent are depicted as rationalists, but their pursuit of Jose is dogmatic. They execute hostages to fish him out. 

Despite being on the run, Jose offers to hear confessions from believers, mainly the rural poor.

In the end, Jose is captured and executed. He has a lasting impact however. In the eyes of some, he's become a saint, which is quite the feat for a whiskey priest. The book ends with a formerly skeptical child taking in another fugitive priest. The Mexican Revolution and the battle between the poor and the conservatives (including the church) is a motif throughout the book. Jose represents the church of course. The lieutenant represents the desire for change, even through violence. Jose hopes to help the poor by getting them into heaven and thinks this is superior to arming them with knowledge. There's irony here as the lieutenant terrorizes the countryside while Jose comforts the poor.

There's biblical allusions throughout the story, though I'm not well versed enough to catch most of them. No doubt his persecution, and eventual martyrdom, alludes to Christ. 

Time is another motif used throughout the story. The destruction of churches took away the clocks, which represents order. Without the churches, people often couldn't tell the time.


**Summary**
The scene looks like something out of “the good, the bad, and the ugly”. Mexico in the 1930s - The Wild West. The first character depicted is a dentist who saw a man who seems to be on the run as well as a child.

Jose is a priest on the run. The police are rounding up and killing priests and the governor seems to have something personal against the church. The Lieutenant is a rationalist and thinks the ultimate punishment is letting a priest live and forcing him to marry. If they believed what they claimed, he thought, they should be willing to die. The church is and was very important to many in the country.

A boy whose family is involved in the “rebellion bill” or war is hiding Juan. 
I’m not sure if it was a flash back, but Juan was asked to say a prayer for a young girl who died. He refuses as it’s apparently illegal to the heartbreak of the parents. Earlier it was revealed that the dentist lost a child at some point. This must be relevant. He moved to Mexico and expected to leave but the revolution caught him off guard. The peso devalued and he had to stay.

The police chief is prepared to murder people to find Juan. He hates the corruption of the church. This is definitely a unique episode in history. The church being persecuted in such a catholic country. What’s the legacy of this war?

The priest is on the run and has come to his home village. He isn’t being welcomed and remarks that the red shirts were there. He said that he’s being forced to understand other peoples problems for once. Maybe he’s referring to their poverty? He, not surprisingly, uses biblical imagery when discussing his struggle. 

The police are rationalists but also dogmatic in their hatred of the church.
The priest is back in his home village and met his daughter. He had an affair with a women there and fathered a child, obviously against his vows. The police are chasing him and the village is an uneasy about harboring a fugitive. They’re happy to get his blessings but want him out by the morning. The police are taking and murdering hostages in pursuit of the priest.  

His daughter might represent the hypocrisy of the church? Why does the priest have a lover and a child? What is he discovering as he runs from the police? His own village won’t take him in. The police arrived at the village. Maria helped him conceal his identity, and the villagers didn’t give him up. Protecting him was an act of treason towards the republic per the police. He ate onions to conceal the alcohol.

The police took a young boy as a hostage since no one turned him in. Maria she knew he wasn’t a good priest and told him to leave. I assume him fathering a child was part of a pattern. That’s why he’s a whiskey priest. 

He feels guilty about his past and when innocents are hurt. What is the symbolism of the police going after these whiskey priests? Corruption in the church is one theme I’m assuming. Poverty and innocent bystanders. The faithful - the villagers dislike him but don’t turn him over. He ran away from the village and I think his daughter followed him. He feels tremendous guilt for his affair but still loves the church. The mother of his child doesn’t respect him nor value the church

He’s on a journey - traveling across a river and through a forest. He’s running from the police but also thinking about the mistakes he made. A mezito (or half caste as he refers to him) as joined him. He can tell that he’s a priest. Jose refers to the man as Judas and is afraid he’ll betray him. If that man’s Judas, the protagonist is Jesus. I don’t know the biblical story well, but Jesus was crucified for claiming to be the son of god by the Romans (I think). There are parallels here.

Christ died for man, especially the sinners. The priest remarks that it’s easy to die for good causes, but it takes a bigger person, a God, to do it for criminals and thieves. He uses that logic to feel sorry for the “half-caste”. He mentions that all the clocks are gone, as they were in church towers which have now been closed. The only way to tell the time is with the sun. There’s symbolism there - time, order, the way of doing things, conservatism itself, was disappearing without the churches.

In the capital city, a beggar helped the priest get access to contraband alcohol. They drink together with the cousin of the governor (who obtains the alcohol) and the chief of police. Why are they meeting over drink? Is this communion like the lit book suggests? They discuss the priest and the police chief said he’s okay leaving him alone, though the government thinks differently. He references his own communion and the priest who attended it. The meeting is the coming together of the police, government, beggar/thief, and (secretly) the priest who just wants wine, and it excludes the church (as the priest is there secretly).

The priest is arrested for having alcohol. In prison he realizes the end is near. He confesses that he’s a priest to the other prisoners. They wish he hadn’t told them and feel sorry for his fate.

Amongst the prisoners the priest confesses who he is. The people seem to be mostly religious themselves as they won’t turn him in. One man attacks the faithful as weak. The priest responds that not believing in something doesn’t mean it isn’t there - i.e. belief in God was self evident to him. He says that he isn’t a martyr and explains his various sins. He sympathizes with a couple having sex amongst the prisoners and says there’s beauty in that sin. Relatedly, he won’t repent for his own sins as he loves b his daughter. He’s criticizing the orthodoxy of the church. He’s still hoping God will save him in the end.

There’s lots of metaphors of time and clocks. No more churches means no more clocks. That makes telling time impossible. There’s also many allusions to the confessional. People are always confessing to him, looking for a absolution. The problem is he himself has sinned so believe he has nothing to offer.

He’s freed from the prison and has went to some house. Some child who’s helped him in the past lives there. He fights with a stray dog over a bone, as he hasn’t eaten in 2 days. He doesn’t know the time because, again, no clocks. He’s reading books in the house and begins to think he’ll once again be able to enjoy life. The books are about the American war of independence.

There was a horrific scene where the priest stumbles upon a dying child who was shot. His mother, an indigenous person, was nearby and wanted to bury the child in a church or something similar. The priest has lost all faith but still wants to help her. They travel day and night and find an indigenous burial ground with crosses and bury the child there. He half hopes for a miracle but says at one point - why should god punish the child with more life. Reminds me of the despair of the [[Rickshaw Boy]] and that Indian movie. He steals the sugar that the mother left for the child - he needs it more. He seems impressed by the mother’s faith but at the same time, the death of an innocent child doesn’t help bring his back.  

After leaving the burial ground and continuing on his journey he stumbles upon a German pair of siblings. They’re Lutherans and seem to have carved out a secret Christian life. The brother escaped from Germany to avoid conscription (from WW1?). People are asking the priest to perform baptisms and listen to their confessions. He agrees for a rate and realizes there’s potential to make some money. The mestizo is back and he learned the American is responsible for the death of the child

The half caste lures the priest to where the dying American is. The priest knowingly goes into the trap and is ambushed by the lieutenant. There’s a kind conversation between the two. The police criticize the church for not helping anyone and exploiting the poor. The priest barely defends himself but also calls out the police’s hypocrisy. He says that while the lieutenant appears to hate the rich he probably wants that life for his kids.

He still sees heaven as the ultimate salvation and defends the church’s attempts to convert the poor. Why not make it easy for the poor to get into heaven? He argues that this is preferable to arming the poor with knowledge. He criticizes the overthrowing the existing power structure with violence in the name of liberating the poor. “It’s better to let him die in dirt and wake in heaven”. 

The priest is arguing against educating the poor of it turns them away from the church. It’s reads like a parody of a defense of conservative thought. 
The lieutenant feels sorry for him and tries to let him confess to Juan padre, but the other priest’s wife doesn’t let him. Remember Juan was allowed to live by agreeing to get married.  

The main priest realizes he’s finally alone. The lieutenant seems to feel sorry for him and is also a little jealous of his faith. I think he wants to confess. The priest does a mock confession to himself. He prays for his daughter and realizes he cares about her more than anything else. He’s human and selfish. He wants to think of everyone but he can’t. He thinks about bargaining with the police by agreeing to marry but it’s too late. His pride got in the way. He’ll die for nothing and with nothing to show God. What was the point?

The last chapter was the most confusing. The priest was executed. The previous chapter ended with the priest wishing he could become a saint. He prayed that night and the way he embraced his death seemed to inspire others. He became a saint after all. One of the officers soaked his handkerchief in his blood and kept it. 

There were conversations between the German couple, the dentist, a mother and child. The story quickly went from one to other and it was hard to keep up. The priest was brave at the end. He was imperfect but his sins were forgiven at the end. The priest at the end was another fugitive priest. Moved by the story of the protagonist, the boy (who originally sheltered Jose) takes in the fugitive priest.

This shows that the church will go on. The state's effort to eradicate it has strengthened it. The boy went from a skeptic (described earlier in the book) to someone who took in a fugitive priest.
