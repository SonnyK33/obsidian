Rajan reviews recent books written by  Foroohar at the FT and Shannon O’Neill who argude arguing in favour of friend-shoring and regionalization.  

Rajan is skeptical of both books and concludes that contries outside of a major regional trading bloc will have the most to lose. This is especially true for those that don’t share "Western  values” i.e. those who aren't under the US' umbrella.   

His thesis highlights how important regional blocs will become. It's another argument in fabour of EU solidarity and explains why it will be impossible for members to leave. It doesn’t bode well for much of Africa and the developing world. It will accelerate regional trade in Latin America.
