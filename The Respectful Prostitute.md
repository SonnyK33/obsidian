The town makes up a story about a black man raping a woman. She initially refuses to testify against him. She’s tricked into signing a statement against him. The white antagonist who set the black man up talks about his destiny and how she can’t go against him. Ideals fall out the window when she eventually gives up the innocent Black man. Continuing on the themes of Flies and Dirty Hands, sometimes principles don't work and you have to focus on self-preservation.
