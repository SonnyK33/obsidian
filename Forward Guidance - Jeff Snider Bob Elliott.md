The different employment surveys are painting different pictures. The household survey and tyres look bad, but jolts and the establishment survey (Current Employment Statistics survey) is okay. This reflects that those who have jobs are doing well. However many people are being left behind and are now being squeezed by costs. This is reflected in the low participation rate.Â There's still a lot of slack in bottom end of market as yellen said.

The market is pricing in aggressive cuts but also a soft landing, which is contradictory. In the 70s, rate hikes increased banks willingness to lend because they saw nominal opportunities. 
This  is why expectations are important. Commercial loans are up, as businesses are anticipating tougher lending standards.
