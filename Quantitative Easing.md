Money is created whenever banks make new loans. Broad money (deposits + currency) can also be created by central banks purchasing treasuries directly from non-banks. The entity will sell treasuries and receive bank deposits. The entity' bank will be credited with new reserves (since the entity doesn't have an account at the Fed) and will also have a new liability (the entity's deposit). The non-bank may then have more cash than it wishes and choose to invest or spend it (the point of QE)

The point of QE was to be spur inflation. However by lowering companies' borrowing costs, it may have allowed them to enter new businesses which weren't immediately profitable (e.g growth tech.) For example, a company may begin selling a new technology for an artifically low price. In this way QE may be disinflationary, and current monetary tightening may actually be inflationary and will lead to higher prices. Along with higher interest income, this may fit with Joseph Wang's "stock and flow" argument.
