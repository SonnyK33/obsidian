Kelton argues that the Clinton surpluses of the late 90s were the cause of the GFC.
This savings-investment connection with the trade balance is:
(S - I) + (T-G) = NX

If the fiscal balance increases, private savings must fall, holding all else equal. Assuming that the trade balance is a function of the capital account which is driven by foreign flows, that argument would hold. She references Godley who argued that the large private deficit would be unsustainable, and hence the budget surplus wouldn't be achieved. 

What's the intuition here? What is the impact of foreign inflows when you have a budget surplus? Foreign capital must go into things other than treasuries. Bernanke in [[Bernanke on Savings Glut]] argued that foreign capital went into the stock market and residential real estate in the run-up to the GFC. A demand for treasuries when the supply is low should mean rates were driven lower and the dollar surged. This would have discouraged savings and increased consumption.
