China doesn’t have an export model but an investment model. That means it must rely on either foreign or domestic savings. China learned from the Latam experience not to rely on foreign savings, and so it needs high domestic savings. 

GDP is either consumed or saved. Among ordinary people, the rich, govt, and businesses, only ordinary people consume more than they save. So you need to drive income away from that group to increase savings. They forced savings into a banking system which then lent for any and all investments. This made sense in the 1980s as the country was drastically underinvested. It now needs to shift, as most demand in the world (75%) is for consumption. If it just brings down investment, and savings stays the same, the trade surplus will grow even further, which other counties can’t absorb. So it has to push up consumption. 
 
Households don’t have enough income relative to segments. The issue isn’t the rich. It's hard to transfer from businesses because that will slow down growth. The only remaining option is from 
governments, specifically local and provincial, who have benefited from this system.  

Other countries have followed this model like Brazil in the 50s. Debt starts to rise after you’ve exhausted good investments as GDP doesn’t rise commensurately. The government is trying to encourage people to consume more but people spend based on individual budget constraints. It needs to either increase the share to housholds or force banks to lend more. 

Chinese, German, Japanese, or Korean businesses aren’t more competitive, they’re subsidized by the government which takes income away from housholds. So it’s the other side to less consumption. Increasing consumption implicitly means lowering manufacturing competiveness. It's the reason why Japan still hasn’t done it.  

Both ends of the imbalance - China and U.S. - end up accumulating debt. The latter because it has to subsidize unemployment caused by trade deficit. The former because you reach the point of diminishing returns for investments, and are forced to invest more and more. 

There isn't a distinction between private and public debt in China because if you default your bank may have to be bailed out. The imbalance helps the same people - Wall Street and owners of movable capital in China ie owners of manufacturing companies. 

At time of bretton woods, officials realized there was no need for free capital flows. Most are speculative and not based on productivity. They also force the economy to adjust to the flows. [[Volatility Machine - WIP]]. The anglophone economies - US, Canada, Uk, Australia have an ideology that you need free capital flows - this gives too much power to the banks. Other countries have gotten competitive by repressing household consumption and investing savings abroad because they can’t use them at home. 

This forces those 4 economies to have large trade deficits - those 4 have 80pct of the world's trade deficits. China started investing savings in developing countries - BRI. But it got burned in Venezuela in 2015. Since then it’s wanted to reduce lending.

Russia has been using surpluses to invest in RMB rather than USD. But China can then respond by either letting its trade deficit decrease by the same amount or investing the same amount in treasuries. So China i sjust intermediating Russian dollar purchases. PBOC actions don’t drive global liquidity directly because of capital controls. Liquidity will stimulate the current account which will lead to buying more treasuries and add more liquidity that way.  

China will be the largest contributor to global growth but what matters to rest of works is trade balance. A larger trade deficit sucks demand from elsewhere and is a headwind to domestic demand in other countries. Although it may lead to higher commodity prices which will help commodity exporters like Brazil. Pettis expects Chinese growth to fall long term because it's hard to switch to consumption, and hard to continue finding productive investments.
