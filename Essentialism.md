**Exec Summary**
This book is about focusing your attention on areas where you can add the most value and eliminating tasks which are not central to your mission. We're constantly distracted by extraneous information and new initiatives and often stray from our most important goals. I read this book because it spoke to what I'm trying to do at work. Now that I have a team, I want to use my time effectively. I want to create routines that lead to good trade ideas avoid reacting to emails or news flow, as much as possible. I read this simultaneously while reading [[Meditations]], and I was struck by how much of this book comes from stoicism. Don't be aimless. Live in the present. 

Either hell yes or no. That's a simple way of prioritizing when you have many competing goals. Only choose things you’re excited about. Reject all others. Have narrow and specific criteria. For every option, have 3 minimum criteria it must pass than 3 tougher criteria of which it must pass 1 or 2. I should write out criteria for investment ideas, separating by rating, catalyst, liquidity, etc. Probably the most important lesson was the need to prioritize and recognize that if you don't, it will be done for you. Edit your to-do list constantly and be a good editor. In most cases, you'll gain more from taking things away than from working harder at what you're doing.

Take the necessary time to think about process and what you're learning. This can feel indulgent at times, but it's much higher value than just grinding through another model. One thing I've already implemented is reading classic literature first thing in the morning, rather than checking my email. 

Think about how issues are connected. You're getting better at this, and a good way to do this is by writing a lot. He recommends role playing. When examining an issue, think about it from multiple perspectives; it may help you see the broader subtext. Go through your notes monthly (he recommends quarterly), and look for patterns and takeaways. 

Get enough sleep. This was the chapter that led me to get the book. Sleep allows for big picture abstract thinking. I know this from my own experience. When I'm tired, I just want to get through the tasks. 

Think about binding constraints. What one change would eliminate other obstacles. What's keeping you from reaching your goal? That's the constraint to eliminate. Make routines. You're getting better at this as well, and it's clear that it helps. You need to have routines for your day, for reacting to news, for looking at credits, etc. There should be a formula which leads to good ideas. They also help avoiding distractions. Routines are how you get into a state of flow. When you feel overwhelmed, just try to change one habit. That can change the direction of your day. What's your goal? Good trades is obvious, but be specific. My goal is to simplify complex  ideas into easily explainable trade theses. How will you know when it’s done? That’s the goal.

As a leader, be strategic about hiring. Communicate goals clearly and delineate roles. Don't leave anything ambiguous. 

Pause before you go home. Focus on family life at home. 


**Summary**

Focus on where your highest point of contribution is. You must recognize real trade offs and act deliberately rather than reacting to one offs. Falling into undisciplined patterns of “more” often turns success into failure. He uses a clothing analogy; if I didn’t own a specific piece would I buy it? If I was looking at this task for the first time, would it make on to my reading list? This works for portfolio management as well. Always looking for your highest level of contribution at that particular time. We must recognize that we have free will, most things are noise, and there are always trade offs.  

1) Explore and identify where you can add value
2) Eliminate. If you don’t prioritize someone else will.
3) Execute.

I don’t have to do anything. I Can’t do everything. Only a few things really matter.  

Chapter 2 - Choose

Recognize you can always choose; that's one thing that can’t be taken away. More effort does not always equal better outcomes. Focus on highest value uses of time. Almost everything is inessential

Chapter 4

Recognize the trade offs and be deliberate. A strategic position isn’t sustainable unless there are trade offs with others. That is, if you try to do your strategy and that of a competitor you’ll be forced to make sacrifices. The traditional media companies launching streaming services to compete with Netflix is a good example.  

Essentialists asks themselves which problem do I want to solve. What to go big on. Embrace the trade offs deliberately. You explore more because you’ll only commit to a few items on the list. 

Chapter 5 escape

Take time to think. We tend to be too busy doing rather than thinking about what we should be doing. Disconnect from technology to eliminate distractions so you can think. Writing without distractions can serve this purpose. You need to take time away to process. He recommends starting very day with 15 mins of classic and inspirational literature that will remind you of classic themes that are timeless. He recommends holy books: the Torah, Upanishad, and classics like Walden in the woods. It helps to reset and center your day.  

Chapter 5

Extract what’s the point from a set of facts. Why does it matter? Think like a journalist. 
What’s the lead? Read between the lines for the bigger picture. It helps to keep a journal
and write about the day. Write less than you want to build the habit. Every 90 days, review the journal entries and look for patterns and takeaways. 

Getting the lead
Understand the spiderweb of the story and interconnected issues. It can help to role play. Put yourself in shoes of characters in story and see it from their perspective. Clarify the question you’re trying to understand.  

Chapter 7

Play around with a topic rather than always pursuing a specific goal. It builds flexibility and adaptability. When stressed, try playing around. For example, when kids are stressed have them draw. 

Chapter 8 sleep

Lack of sleep prevents big picture thinking. The best violinists practice the most but also sleep the most.

Chapter 9 choose

Either hell yes or no. Only choose things you’re excited about. Reject all others. Have narrow and specific criteria. For every option, have 3 minimum criteria it must pass than 3 tougher criteria of which it must pass 1 or 2. E

Eliminate options 
If starting from scratch would you pick it? If you don’t say no you’re saying yes  

Chapter 10 clarify 

Have a single strategic and simple goal. It clarifies and answers many other questions at once. It also eliminates many other possibilities. If you can only be excellent at one thing, which thing would it be. Don’t waste time on specific words, just write something out. 

Avoid sunk cost bias
Your menu of opportunities should be reevaluated constantly. Would you add these if you were starting from scratch now? Film editing is key to a good film.  Winners at the Oscar’s for best editor and pic are correlated. Editing is eliminating the nonessential. Try to be an editor: shorten and clarify. Can you say this in a simpler way? Is the core message getting through?

Look for binding constraints 
Instead of working harder, remove things to speed up process. Remove binding constraints. Focus on the end goal. How will you know when it’s done? That’s the goal.

What’s keeping you from getting there? Which constraint when removed will remove others as well? 

Don’t be reactive with band-aid solutions. Think about your goal and take away things rather than adding more and more effort. The constraint may be you trying to make it perfect. 
 

Chapter 17
Habits and small changes to frequent behavior may be more powerful rather than grand changes. Attempt to achieve minimal viable progress. 
 

Chapter 18

Routines are key to focusing on what’s important and avoiding distractions. It allows you to focus mental attention elsewhere. Success should be natural extension of your routine, and you should set aside time upfront to create the right routine. Pay attention to cues which are leading to nonessential and distracting behavior. 

Create new triggers
Do hardest thing first. You could have different routines for different days. Don’t try changing all routines at once.  

Chapter 20

Focus on the present and the moment which is all you can control. Don't worry about the past or the future. Once you have a routine you can live in the moment in a state of flow, much like Aurelius says in [[Meditations]].  

Multitasking may be possible but not multi-focusing. When overwhelmed make a list of what needs to be done right now and go through it. Then make a second list of stuff that you want to get done at some point in the future based on current thoughts. 


Pause before you go home to clear your head and focus on home life. Become essentialist in all aspects of life not just as a side project. As a leader, hire the right people. One wrong hire much worse than missing one person. Give people as few tasks as possible and check in to remove obstacles. Communicate clearly and often. What is the team's goal?  

Ours is to simplify the complex. Distill complex and disparate credits into factors and trends. 
Eliminate ambiguity for roles and responsibilities. He cited Thiel at PayPal who gave  everyone has just one task. Check in often on key goals. If there are too many goals, the team will learn that you will shift priorities and won’t hold them accountable. They’ll focus on what’s easiest rather than important.
