[[Myth of  Sisyphus]]
Sophists believe in relativism, and that truth is different for everyone.  The man is more important than the argument. They would win argumentw with ad hominem.

**Socrates** 
He questioned things until he got at the truth. Through his questioning, he exposed contradictions. This is what we now call the socratic method. He was humble regarding things he didn’t understand. He was willing to admit he knew nothing and would ask questions until he did. He didn’t write anything down so we have to rely on what his students said about him, most importantly Plato. Plato’s **The Apology** chronicles the trial against Socrates.

Socrates was  not a relativist and believed morals were absolute. He thought that a life not examined wasn’t worth living. The point of being alive was to acquire knowledge and question things. He didn’t care about personal hygiene and would trade good conversation for food and shelter. He was convicted because he refused to manipulate the jury with his superior intellect. He thought it was more important to point out their flawed arguments than to survive.

**Comparisons with Absurdism**
Camus said that the only point of being alive was to live. In some ways this is the opposite of what Socrates thought. According to Camus, there were no higher truths (except man's inability to reconcile his desire for truth with the irrational world). But Socrates would have agreed that this analysis itself was a reason to live.
