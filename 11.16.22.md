8am
Market digesting Russia de-escalation. Stocks are up/flat and rates are lower again today. Definitely seems like rates will keep going down until we get more hawkish news. Gold is also up which is in line with market thinking rates have stabilized for now and real rates not going down further. Oil is down a little, probably due to decreasing Russia tension. KWEB was up 10% yesterday; I bought but not enough as usual. 

12pm
Long bond now up 1.5% and stocks are down 0.7%. Looks like CTAs have taken over rates and I missed my chance to buy more for now.  KWEB down 2.4% after being up 10% yesterday.
