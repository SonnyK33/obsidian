Brazil and Argentina to begin discussing a common currency. Lula has in the past mentioned a desire for a BRICS currency. Increasing trade between Argentina and Brazil as well as ideological Allies make it more likely. Brazil will likely be wary of Argentinaâ€™s high inflation though and would need to get a weaker currency (like Germany did with the Euro) to boost exports in return.
