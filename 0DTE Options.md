0DTE options are increasing the risk of outsized moves. Because more participants are using them over longer dated options, the VIX is a less reliable gauge of volatility. Most participants are selling calls. If there are big moves against sellers, they’re forced to close positions which can cause outsized moves. Sellers don’t need margin for intraday selling. The positive gamma dealers have from holding options evaporates quickly if options move far from the strike. They’ll start to exacerbate moves as gamma decreases.
