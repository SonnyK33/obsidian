Japan has much higher excess private savings than Germany, UK, or the US (does US have excess savings? I thought a current account deficit implies it doesn’t). Most of these excess savings are held in the corporate sector (6 of 8pct of GDP). Savings must equal investment once you include the government and foreigners. This is offset by the government investing and capital account surpluses. In Germany, UK, and US, household savings almost equal corporate savings. In Japan, corporate savings are more than 3x household. 

The government is trying to stimulate demand in the face of excess savings through negative rates and YCC. They’re trying to avoid deflation. The high investment phase of the post war period ended, but consumption never increased. Investment however hasn’t increased despite low rates. Likely because demand is low. They have allowed the government to borrow cheaply and invest. The 8pct excess savings is offset by 5pct government deficit and 3pct capital account deficit / current account surplus.  

Germany ran larger capital account deficit allowing for private and government excess savings. If Japan had done the same would’ve meant an even higher current account surplus, possibly angering the US. I don’t understand the exchange rate argument. This should depreciate the Yen, and be inflationary I think.  

Germany runs a large capital account deficit because it can export to the rest of the EU. If not for the eurozone, its currency would be much stronger, possibly leading to deflation. It may have caused a currency crisis with the deutchemark vs other European currencies.

Japan could also raise corporate taxes and try to shift more income to households or employees via profit distributions.

Wages are too low and profits too high. It must shift excess profits into consumption.
