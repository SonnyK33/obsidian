Subsidies and industrial policy may be a waste of fiscal resources for developing countries. Even the success stories like 19th century US relied on foreign capital and technology.

The article seems to downplay the role of tariffs in the 19th century. which the US had at the time (as does China) and which strengthened domestic markets. The optimal policy mix may be trade tariffs but openness to foreign capital, technology, and professionals.
