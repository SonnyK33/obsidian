Aristotle's Prime mover theory is that some thing started motion initially. It’s the unmoved mover or the prime mover. Movement also means changing from one state to another like wood to fire. To Aquinas, the prime mover was god. He combined Christian faith with reason from Aristotle. The key contradiction was Aristotle believed the universe has always existed and Christians believed god created it. Aquinas combined the two; god has always existed and he created the universe. Since he’s always existed, the universe could’ve been created at any time, that is, even arbitrarily long ago.
