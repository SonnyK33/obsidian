**US Federal Reserve**
The Reverse Repo Facility (RRP) is a mechanism by which the Fed puts a floor on the overnight lending rate. The Fed sells securities held in its account (SOMA) and agrees to buy them back for a set price. The difference between the two is the reverse repo rate. The action temporarily shifts liabilities owed to the banking sector (reserves) into reverse repos. Treasury securities are held in the SOMA. 

T-Account:
Fed - 
DR reserve liability (reduces liability)
CR Repo liability (increases liability)
