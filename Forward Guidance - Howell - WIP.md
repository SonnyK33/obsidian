Liquidity bottomed in Oct 22. Since then it’s risen from the PBOC, a weaker dollar, and lower bond volatility which makes it easier to repo. The lack of TGA issuance and the RRP have offset QT. The Fed is more concerned with the functioning of the treasury market than rates. They need to cut rate vol and may eventually move to YCC like Japan. There are $3tr of bank reserves and the Fed says the  min is 1.5. Some academics say it should be 2.5 or there could be issues with refinancing. The TGA will be more volatile because of debt ceiling issues and tax season. There's a chance that the TGA goes below a minimum threshold which is why bank reserves are being kept constant. 

  

A lot of pboc liquidity coming in - more than twice previous years 

This will boost commodities

Likes crypto bc tracks easing of liquidity 

Check crossborders twitter

Liquidity tracks a n average of Gould and crypto

  

Liquidity drives financial markets

Which drives the real economy 

  

Likens this year to post tech bubble,

To 2002

Chinese liquidity is completely different now vs then 

In 2002 had impact of 911 and no China easing 

Big driver now are lower bond vol, higher commodity prices, and China liquidity 

  

Equities - likes commodities and EM (China) and cyclicals though that’s more dangerous

Fed wants to reduce

Bs but keep reserves flat

That requires winding down RRP

They can adjust rates on that to force it 

  

Fed is paying more on RRP than earning on treasuries and MBS

That loss is liquidity for the system 

  

Treasury has said TGA could go sub 100 but would like it to be 700

It’s

500 now so there’s a lot of vol in short term 

2tr RRP is a bigger factor 

  

Yield curve inversion does predict recessions but different pairs work better for different recessions

Have tor take into account convexity 

Right now the negative term premia matters bc

The curve is more

Inverted bc of negative term premia in the 10yr

That’s caused by a shortage of collateral

Inversion tells you more about financial

Than Econ fragility

  

Doesn’t think they’ll cut this year

Fed is maintaining financial stability w balance sheet and fighting inflation w rates

  

Fed will cut eventually as inflation. Comes down but term premia will

 Be rising due to less foreign demand

Japan more focused on buying its own bonds

China and Saudi buying fewer treasuries

Rates market will range trade and hence so will equities 

  

Historically strong flows into the US and EU caused by a lack of good collateral

Basel III required banks to hold more and QE took most of it out of circulation esp in Europe

  

$60tr global debt due every year

Given higher rates and all the debt due for refi debt to gdp will rise

This will require more liquidity

Gdp will

Be growing at a slower pace 

So liquidity to gdp is rising which means higher multiples

The fed will do YCC bc they can’t pay higher rates

So don’t buy treasuries

Buy stocks and commodities and crypto

Thinks soft landing 

Business cycle still has to turn so could be short term noise 

Likes China bc of the liquidity
