Bell uses his former position as the Dean of the political theory department at the University of Shandong to explain Chinese political thinking to Western audiences. As the US tries to isolate China and slow its growth, this book attempts to explain the Chinese political system to Westerners. While it is sympathetic to the Chinese system of political meritocracy, It doesn't hesitate to criticize China and President Xi for growing censorship and the abandonment of term limits. Bell is a scholar of Confucianism and he puts contemporary Chinese political theory in the context of its ancient traditions. The most important takeaways for me were the rise of Confucianism in contemporary Chinese political thought and how Xi's embrace of Communism is fully in line with the timeline envisioned by Marx. Karl Marx believed that Communism would appear in developed countries first, not in peasant societies like China in the 1950s. If you follow that logic, China first had to become capitalist to destroy feudalism and build the required means of production. This is what Deng Xiaoping did. Now Xi is trying to clean up corruption which was a natural outgrowth of the opening in the 1980s and 1990s. But this is the trickiest part of Marxism. The dictatorship of the proletariat (i.e. the current CCP) is supposed to just dissolve. This is at odds with the strong administrative state being built. It also seems at odd with the ancient Chinese traditions and Confucian practices. The crossroads of Confucian and Communist thought is the most interesting part of this book. The push back against the relentless propaganda so common in the West today regarding China is also very refreshing. We never learn about the corruption that Xi stamped out and how popular that's been. Of course there are risks with Xi removing term limits. But those are highlighted constantly. The Confucian method of teaching, tailored to each student was also very interesting. The discussion on censorship and how Mill was more worried about public opinion and self-censoring reminded me about Orwell's foreword to 1984 and reminded me to reap Lipton.   

It's necessary to read this on conjunction with all of the economic critiques going on, especially from Pettis. How does this intersection between Marxism and ancient traditions mix with the need to grow domestic demand? What does Marx say about domestic demand and savings vs investment, if anything? What does Confuscious thought say about economic growth?


**Resurgence of Confucianism in China**

Confucianism reached its low point during the cultural revolution, but leadership is now trying to make it the public face of the country. The philosophy has never been against economic modernization like many others have (Buddhism?). China has once again become the academic center for Confucianism with many leading professors moving from the US. One academic published reports showing Chinese students are more likely to use confusion dialects to solve problems.

It promotes collective well being and morality, but it took a backseat to specific poverty alleviation during rise of communism. It also puts a heavy focus on meritocracy. Does this unite a large portion of Chinese population? It seems to be the best unifier, especially as Chinese people are increasingly proud of their past. Bell  became interested in it as it related to his study of communitarianism. The school he deans educates CCP members and cadres and is home for retired members. He acknowledges that his political agenda is to de-demonize CCP. He also acknowledges the risk in ending term limits for Xi and issues with the Uigyurs. But he argues that there's no risk of China attacking the US. Conversely, it is surrounded by US bases and has much to fear. 

The CCP is popular even with Chinese abroad and those able to travel. That’s a function of the economic growth in the past 50 years and increases in living standards. Most CCP officials are trying to make things better for the Chinese people, and aren't particularly ideological.  

**Dying Hair**

White air has always been a sign of frailty and so political leaders always dye it black. Xi broke this norm, possibly signifying that he's first among equals. He also led the popular anti-corruption drive which previous leaders weren’t willing to do. But he may have taken his individual leadership (vs the rest of party) too far. 

The government does a disservice with poor translations, including the Ministry of Propaganda. But western governments consider all non-electoral democracies as illegitimate, and they put the CCP in the same category as NK or Saudi without caring about any differences or appreciating its historical legacies with meritocracy. There have been tremendous changes despite one party rule. The author is being generous - the US considers any government that opposes it as illegitimate including electoral democracies. The US either topples them or brands them as authoritarian. It absolutely  appreciates the difference between it and NK which is why it fears China. It worries that the Chinese way may work.

The Suchi system has government appointed bureaucrats who police faculty. They can be annoying as they do censor academics, but they can also be fair. He highlights an episode where an anti-communist former faculty leader wasn’t kicked out of a WeChat group because they hadn’t kicked out other ex-faculty members. He was eventually removed for disruptive comments, but it highlights there is some order.  

Deng sought to avoid the personality cult and established term limits, while he still exercised control when retired. That is, Xi's level of authority isn't completely unprecedented.  

Administrative positions are prestigious even though they pay less. This is an ancient tradition where leadership was through meritocracy except for the emperor. In Shandong, 7 is the lucky number because of the phrase "57 up, 58 down" meaning up or out at 57.

Collective leadership may be a good thing, but certain conditions necessary. There needs to be a first among equals who has moral and formal authority. Dissent should be allowed and encouraged. Emperors in China were absolute rulers, but decisions were recorded for posterity which was a partial check. Corruption, that is the use of public funds for private use is the worst thing a Confucian leader can do. It's cited as a contributor to the fall of the Ming and Chin dynasties. It was also a factor in the CCP's victory over the KMT who were able to appeal to the people.  

Mao wasn’t guilty of corruption for money but was drunk with power. People died because of persecution and poor policies. After Deng opened up the economy, many officials starting looking for their cut. Corruption became rampant, reaching a tipping point in 2012 when Xi took over. Polls showed corruption was the public’s number 1 issue with the system e.g. University admissions was perceived as unfair. Xi's predecessors half heartedly went after corruption. They recognized it as a threat to CCP rule though.  

Xi punished 1m officials including a dozen high ranking military officials. The West portrays this as going after his enemies, but he made many enemies by going after so many people and disturbing practices. People can see the change as paying bribes and other forms of corruption are looked down upon. People are able to access public services without paying bribes.  

Even with Leninism which had one party rule, there is an ancient tradition of legalism that is rule by law not of law. It's the alternative to Confucian compassion. The Chin dynasty pioneered the legalist method and unified China but it was the shortest dynasty, lasting only 15 years.  

Xi’s anti corruption drive, while initially popular, has resulted in more bureaucracy and regulations. Mundane things like the size of the dean’s office or his meal allowance require approval from hire ups. The flip side has been the end of term limits and age limits which limited power. Academia is further limited as more topics became off limits. Officials are so focused on not being implicated that they’re paralyzed in making decisions. Decisions made post Covid were an example of this. Everyone is focused on their boss and their favor versus the public good.

The focus now is to remove the incentives for corruption perhaps with higher public salaries and separating the economics from political decision making, rather than deterrence. Moral education rooted in Confucian classics may be used. They could empower junior officials while regulating senior ones. The anti-corruption drive is over now and fewer officials are being punished. There's more focus on the Confucian classics for teaching morality.   

**Chapter 5**

Excess drinking without getting drunk i.e. proving tolerance is rooted in Confucian classics. Confucious talked about his ability to hold his liquor and not misbehave. Drunk driving used to be a serious problem, but eventually norms were enforced by the threat of punishment. When the norms were solidified, punishment became less necessary. His use of “rituals” as described by chintza, a Confucian scholar, could be likened to Norms or institutions. 

**Chapter 6**

Confucian Analects should be read as Congtza having a dialogue with and teaching different students. One should first understand the different students as the teachings are tailored individually.    

Shintza was a political theorist in the Confucian tradition who lived during warring states period. The Confucian tradition focuses on students individually based on their needs and biases and crafts the curriculum accordingly. It seems to based on discussion and rigorous principles not unlike stoicism. It gives students the benefit of the doubt for a long time, and doesn't give up on them until they’re much older and still lacking ambition.
  
**Chapter 7 Marxist comeback**

Marxism was fading in favour of Chinese characteristics i.e. practicality, but it had a comeback post GFC when the government tried to figure out what went wrong. Xi’s focus now is to level the playing field for opportunities, not income. He cracked down on tech monopolies, real estate bubbles, and tutoring which was only accessible to the rich. He favored common prosperity - “lower communism” - which focused on opportunities not outcomes. Some fear this will go against the entrepreneurial spirit. 

Marxist scholars faded in the 1980s, but today it’s a prestigious field again with many promising students. Western media associates this trend strictly with Xi, that without him it would have trended further towards market reforms and electoral democracy. Xi is actually following Marx’s theory of history. China was too poor for Marxism during the time of Mao (which is why he thought it would come to Germany and the UK first). They first needed Deng’s capitalism to create the industry and technology. Then the workers can rise up and exploit technology for drudge work while they focus on living. 
Marx recognized capitalism's ability to initially create factors of production efficiency.   

The CCP never let go of Marxist ideals in the 1980 and 90s. Private property has a 70 year lease with the understanding that it will be taken back at some point. This is higher communism. A dictatorship of the proletariat is required between the  capitalist and communist phases. It's necessary to prevent a ruling class and to develop needed resources. The Marxist end game is an anarchy with no state or ruling class.  

Bakunin the anarchist writer said that the proletariat wouldn’t let go of power and the state would form a new elite which rules over rest. Higher communism requires the abolishment of the state. The dictatorship of the proletariat is supposed to give up power. Marx doesn’t explain how elections will be conducted in a non-political fashion. 
He also says that communism will have to be a global phenomenon as it will be difficult to implement in one country while foreign capitalist countries remain hostile to it.  

The Chinese state has become more bureaucratic as it’s become more complex. This fits with its Confucian history which selected leaders based on merit and virtue. It's increasingly likely that the state isn’t going away. Some argue that AI and modern technology will make this easier, but it’ll still require human intervention. 

The CCP is increasingly leaning on Confucian history to teach virtue and ethics to its leaders. Some of the ancient dynasties had a society that resembled communism but with leadership. The Great Unity in Han dynasty's book of rituals for example. In it the poor were taken care of and resources were plentiful. This may have inspired Mao. 

**Chapter 8**- **Censorship** 

John Stuart Mill is most influential writer on censorship, but he was more afraid of public opinion than state censorship. This is true in the West today, but state censorship is more important in China. The author's classes are rarely censored except for Marxism, as his interpretation may differ. Rules around censorship are not enforced to the letter, and there is much more censorship with Chinese language publications. 
The new generation of censors are younger, and have a more international outlook. However, they’re also more ideological than in the 1980s when people were looking towards the West.  

The author used to be courted by western media who were interested in a foreigner political theorist working in China. That completely ended in the past few years as the West’s hostility to China grew. There is zero room for any contrary viewpoints. Everyone agrees that the government is evil to its own people and is bent on foreign domination. This is partially due to more repression in China, but it's mainly because there's been a realization that the Chinese aren’t weak and they don’t want to be like the West. In the past they looked at Western liberalization for inspiration. Now there’s more pride in ancient traditions including Confucianism. The US also fears being surpassed by China, and that its model of state intervention will be replicated in the developing world. 

Chinese style repression is worse, but at least it's open and will admit why it's censoring. The Western media won’t admit that it's censoring; it's tough to do so  when you claim to be committed to free speech.  

The dichotomy that the US draws between democracies and autocracies is not useful. China isn’t run by a family or the military; it's run by a meritocratic political system. The West refuses to see anything other than electoral democracy as legitimate and doesn't acknowledge the risk of economic concentration and its effect on democracy. I’d say this gives the US too much credit. It has no problem with many autocracies. China is based on political meritocracy which has some advantages. It can focus on the long-term, chooses the most virtuous leaders, it doesn’t empower demagogues who lie, and it isn't beholden to economic interest. It gives everyone the chance to lead, but it acknowledges that some lack the moral code to do so. This is the ideal obviously, and there is still corruption, and the new lack of term limits will be empower incumbents. In West, even this ideal is criticized, and I'd say that isn't because of principles. 

**Chapter 9** - Academic meritocracy 

Appointments tend to be fair, but the process can be too rigid for doctoral students. There's a strange culture of "cuteness" which started in Japan in the 1970s and has spread to rest of East Asia. It's pervasive even among professionals, and it sometimes shields real emotions and is used in place of real political thought or consciousness. 

**Chapter 11 - Symbolic leadership** 

Despite ending the imperial system, some Confucian scholars argue in favor of a symbolic leader. The only one who would be respected is a direct descendant of Confucius. In the Ming Dynasty, the emperor withdrew from rituals. This shattered the myth of the emperor as divine, and belief was based on those rituals. Side note - that's a good reason why missionaries discouraged ancient rituals in Hawaii [[History of Hawaii]].

It can be powerful when the leader only occasionally speaks up and tries to intervene. He appears more objective. There's some lessons here from The Crown. Constitutional monarchies tend to perform well. They separate rituals and national myths from political leadership. They're less likely to have populists. People are less likely to fall in love with political leadership as they don’t represent the nation in an emotional sense. 

This  reminded me of Zeus’ advice in [[Flies]]. He warned Orestes that it's important that the King went through the same experiences as the people. In that case, the King reinforced those experiences with a strange ritual every year recognizing the killing of King Agamemnon. McArthur kept the Emperor of Japan in place, as that made it easier to implement land reform as conservatives were assured. Trump and Xi by contrast built a cult of personality.
