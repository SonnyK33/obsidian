Long-term rates should be equal to compounding short-term rates set by the Fed + a term premium. This premium compensates holders for locking in rates. 

Term premia have come down due to low inflation and flight to quality flows. 

As inflation becomes More volatile and if treasuries lose some flight to quality status (due to poor performance this year), term premia should rise.
