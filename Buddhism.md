Buddhism tries to answer whether it is possible to end human suffering. 

The Buddha - Siddharta - was born into immense wealth. His mother died when he was young, and so never experienced that pain. He never saw old age or suffering. One day on a walk he finally saw poverty and old age. 
  
The Aryan invasion occurred just prior to this period  c. 600bc. The Aryans  imposed Hinduism and rituals on the people. Locals were weary and were looking for something different. It became popular to question the omnipotence of gods. Renunciants and ascetics were those who rejected traditional Hinduism.

Siddharta abandoned life as a prince and lived as an ascetic depriving himself of everything. This also yielded nothing, and he discovered the third way between the extremes. That’s when he sat under the tree and reached nirvana and realized 4 truths:

1) Suffering is universal 
It’s the default state.  We grow tired even of things we once loved. All joy is fleeting.  

2) What’s the cause of suffering?
The attachment to things and aversion - when our expectations for something aren’t met. Both lead to ignorance and to  thinking that your happiness depends on external events. Events aren’t good or bad. Your circumstances determine how they impact you.  

3) Suffering comes from desire. 

Which comes from us thinking that we exist separately from the universe and other people. Everything that happens is just a function or previous events and karma. The universe is just slowly unfolding.

4) How to end and reach nirvana.

Meditation is another word for mindfulness which is about being self aware of your thoughts and focusing only on the productive ones.
