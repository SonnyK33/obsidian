Oil prices could spike when caps come into effect in early December. 2.3m bbl/d will need to find a new destination and will need vessels that don't need Western insurance to operate.

Follow-ups:
- GCC countries worried caps could be used against them (why they're supporting Russia)
- Who are the non-Western insurance companies who could insure vessels?
	- how many of these dark vessels exist?
	- has Venezuela been using them?
- how much does it cost to insure a vessel?
- How much more expensive would oil be without this insurance?
- Will this bring India closer with China
- 

- oil market will get a lot tighter with the EU price cap set to start next week
- the cap price hasn't been finalized (some EU states calling for $20 and US calling for $65 - prettyÂ close to what they're currently getting)
- any vessels carrying oil to a country not abiding by cap won't be able to access UK or EU insurance
- the EU embargo supersedes these caps and so won't be able to buy oil at any price
- Russian oil production has almost completely retraced gap since war began
- Russia produces 10% of global oil
	- 2.4m bbl/d of production will need to find new destination outside of EU or G7 - China/India will take up some of this, as said won't participate in caps

- would require 100 additional vessels willing to operate w/o Western insurance - will be hard to find this, even with "dark fleet" - e.g. tankers used by Iran -> could push oil to $120
- Vitol estimating Russian exports fall by 1m b/d (20%)
