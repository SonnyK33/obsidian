I liked this framework for how to deal with current account deficits and what questions to focus on.

Assuming it's hard to cut imports:
1) Increase exports by having a competitive exchange rate (assuming exports are sufficiently elastic)
2) Increase incentives for FDI
	1) Better solvency laws
3) Reduce fiscal deficits as these crowd out the private sector by raising local interest rates
	1) This makes it hard for businesses to attract adequate credit to develop products for exports
4) Stop import substitution
	1) these generate abnormal profits for producing for the domestic market 
	2) reduces incentives to export 
	3) goes hand in hand with encouraging 

Realzing the benefits from adequate credit requires the other steps 

The key drivers for current account deficits are savings and investment rates. There are different factors which affect a country's ability to save and invest. One that's often ignored is the fertility rate. A high fertility rate increases the dependency ratio (children + retired people / working age population). The young and old consume more and invest less. Developing countries with high dependency ratios save less. Pakistan for example has higher fertility rates than India or Bangladesh and hence a higher dependency ratio. This is one reason for its perpetual current account deficit.
