Philosophy started to overlap with religion at this time. Both tried to appease humans' fear of irreversible events especially death. Religion says the next life will be better, while philosophy says you can get past this fear with reason. At this time lots of efforts were made to describe what it means to be human. Christianity became popular partially because people liked the idea of personal salvation and the afterlife. 

Existence vs Higher existence

If asked how can evil exist with a God, Plotinus would say all evil is just the absence of good. He looked at everything as a hierarchy with the “one” on the top. Intellect is below that which captures the true form like the reality in cave allegory [[Plato]].  Below that is the soul which is what we perceive. The one overflows into the next tier like a fountain.  

So how can bad exist?
The absence of good is what we perceive in the bottom rung of the fountain. The physical world is a watered down version of the One. So the good stuff gets watered down by the time we perceive it, which we perceive as a deficiency. This is similar to the Buddhist take on suffering. Events are not good or bad; your personal circumstances dictate how they affect you. Adversity is just the other side of the coin of something positive happening. (E.g. learn from the moment of pain to help others). [[Buddhism]]
