Market is pricing in a mild recession but not a proper one.Â 
Takeway is to sell put spread. Maybe Sell 360, buy 300 for dec 2023.
  
Bond market pricing in 100bps cut next year in line with a recession but not 400bps in line with a proper recession (he calculates odds of a certain fed funds rate with options on Eurodollar contracts)  

Market is assigning 16% odds to a 20% drawdown in S&P - higher than 10-12pct which is the norm (he calculates this with put spreads)

I think he calculates option implied probabilities by dividing option premia by the payoff. Some people use overlapping butterfly spreads to interpolate the option implied probabilities of certain events. 

Price of option = probability of event x payoff of event
