[[A Monetary and Fiscal History of the US 1961-2021]]
[[Fiscal Theory of the Price Level]]

Quantity theory of money (Friedmans monetarism) is special case where the only way the govt can finance itself is through base money issuance. When Friedman was writing, domestic bond markets were undeveloped so was a reasonable assumption. Today the US bond market is 100pct of gdp so a small increase in spending which translates to issuance can lead to price increases.  

Fiscal theory says it’s the sum of money and bonds that matters, ie fiscal drives inflation not monetary policy. This explains why QE didn’t lead to inflation, the 2020 stimulus did. They just replaced treasuries with base money ie reserves. This changed the composition of liabilities not the amount. 

  

If have a large nominal stack of debt, takes little inflation to reduce the amount of liabilities 

  

Value of states debt is the present value of future surpluses generated to pay off the debt 

  

A lot more demand for securities than base money 

  

Pre 2008, was 800bn it hard currency and 20bn of reserves

Bc there’s more demand for bonds than base money, esp in developed countries, having a domestic bond market allowed you to spend more without causing inflation

  

Having a lot of debt also allows you to inflate it away more easily 

  

Many EMs - Chile,

Peru, argenjntq, Israel didn’t have domestic bond markets in the 1980s and would’ve have had high inflation immediately if Covid had hit 

  

Market value of us debt has actually gone down since March 2020 due to higher rates

Has already inflated away all issuance 

  

Govt issues bonds at rates based on future expectations 

Ie of think inflation will come down doesn’t make sense to issue bonds at high coupons bc will be hard to generate enough income to pay them off

45pct of feds mbs we’re issued in 2021

Homeowners refinanced and Fed bought back mortgages at lower rates 

They’re taking a loss on those as rates rise and the duration rises due to negative convexity

  

Policy favorites the rich as they’re more likely to own and we’re able to refi

Renters now face much steeper rents

  

Unlike 2009, there wasn’t a need to buy MBS since home prices were rising 

  

When debt ceiling blocked Obama from spending, Fed auctioned off assets to finance spending 

Lots of forms of fiscal dominance 

  

The feds ability is to take large losses is based on ability to do at a low rate of inflation

The limit is lower for other countries and prob based on credibility
