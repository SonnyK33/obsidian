If trade was running per fundamentals, the US would be running a trade surplus. In normal times, capital flows from rich countries with an abundance of technology and developed financial markets to less developed countries who need capital. The US should have a high savings rate, partially exacerbated to high levels of income inequality (the rich can save more). A high savings rate would  mean a lower consumption share and hence less imports. Capital flows means the US should run a capital account deficit and consequently a trade surplus (why?). 

Shifts in income distribution affect the savings rate and the investment rate. Investment, along with the capital account, affects ex-post savings (the actual savings rate vs the ex-ante savings - what households plan to save). Any savings that aren't invested must be exported. Exported capital will pay for imports. So the excess savings translates to a current account surplus and a current account deficit. 

In rich countries, high savings won't fully translate to higher investment as investment needs are limited. In poor countries, when infrastructure needs are great, higher savings (and equivalently, lower consumption) should translate to higher investment. Excess savings (S - I) leads to a current account surplus and capital account deficit. Higher savings means less consumption and hence less imports. Excess savings in one region are used to purchase financial assets in another. That is, they're used to import financial assets and leads to a capital account deficit. For example, when excess Chinese savings are used to purchase US treasuries that creates a capital market deficit (DR or "import"). 

In the US, income inequality drives a higher savings rate. One would expect this to lead to a capital account deficit and current account surplus. 



**Savings Rate**
This is a function of income distribution. As income shifts to richer or older households, savings should increase, and consumption should decrease. All income is by definition either saved or consumed. Businesses don't consume and save all of their income, which is either invested or distributed to shareholders. 

**GDP Accounting Identities**
GDP = Savings + Consumption
GDP = Consumption  + Investment + Capital Account Surplus
Consumption + Savings = Consumption + Investment + CA Surplus

Since CA balance = -Current Account Balance

Savings = Investment + (-Current Account Deficit)
Current Account Deficit =  Investment - Savings

**Current Account vs Capital Account Example**
An export leads to a credit entry on the current account, as an item is flowing out of the country. It leads to an equivalent debit on the capital ccount, as it's importing the currency to purchase the item. A current account deficit neccessitates a capital account surplus, as the country would be exporting an equivalent amount of capital to finance the net imports. 


The US exports a car to Germany for $1000. Assume the EUR exchange rate is USD 1.1 per EUR.

1) The German importer converts EUR 909 into $1000

US Capital Account
CR $1,000 (dollars exported to Germany)
DR EUR 909 (Euros imported to US)

German Capital Account
CR EUR 909 
DR $1,000 

2) The German purchases the car for $1,000. He is exporting $1,000 and importing a car. The US is exporting a car and importing the $1,000.

US Current Account
CR $1,000 (car)

US Capital Account
DR $1,000 (currency repatriated)

German Current Account
DR $1,0000

German Capital Account
CR $1,000
