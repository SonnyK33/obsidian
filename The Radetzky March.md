**Executive Summary**
I read this book while reading [[[The World of Yesterday]], in preparation for our trip to Vienna. This book is about the fall of the Austria-Hungarian empire, as embodied in a family, the Trottas, whose ascendancy and then decline mirror the Kingdom. Zweig's book talked about the arrogance of Austrians and how they ignored what was happening around them. The Trottas, who come from the periphery themself, are well aware of the empire's fragility. That makes them hold on to tradition even tighter. When the grandson of the original Trotta is killed by rebels (likely Slavics), their story comes full circle. Many of Zweig's themes appear in this book as well-- the hyper rationality of privileged Austrians, the sexual repression, the lack of visible affection, and the respect for authority. Although they believed their King to be benevolent and their country to be democratic, calls for universal suffrage were pulling the country apart. The Trotta grandson had to put down rebellions from the parts of the empire where his family originated. His death, and that of his family, coincides with the Kaiser, and the Austrian empire. This book also serves as a kind of prequel to the [[The Jungle]]. The immigrants in that story comes from the periphery of the Austrian empire and are the people who pull apart the empire. There's two very different stories happening in parallel, the rich nobility in Vienna (the subject of Zweig's book), and poor at the edges of the empire, from where the Trottas originate, and who end up being the subject of [[The Jungle]].

The introduction to book discusses the politics of the day and the context in which the book was written. I learned a new word  - feuilleton - a short catchy vignette which cleverly discusses news of the day. It’s separate from the political news, and is meant to be light hearted but ingenious. I strive to write like that. The authors background was in writing pieces like that.

One takeaway I got was that the author attributes the collapse of the empire to its failure to internalize the Slavic elements of the empire, as it did the German and Hungarian ones. [[The World of Yesterday]] also talks about Austrians' obliviousness to everything that was happening on its periphery. 

The book is surprisingly readable. Trotta just saved the life of emperor Josef and has been propelled into aristocracy. He’s Slovenian and from the edge of the empire. He was marginal until this one random act. Trotta is angered when a rendition of the battle is altered in his son's book and he is made into a cavalry officer. He’s embarrassed by his peasant father who later passes away. His wife passes away, and then he later dies. He lived a regimental and boring life. He determined his son would be a lawyer and that was that. There’s a lot of imposter syndrome as well as pride with saving the Kaiser that day in the battle. He continued to benefit from the favor of the Kaiser and later became a baron.

A new scene started with Carl Trotta, a 15 year old returning home for summer holidays. His relationship with his father is very formal and rigid. Tradition is valued above all. This is the son and grandson of the original Trotta. The son pushed the grandson into the military as well. The grandfather's portrait still hangs and weighs on the grandson. He’s more of a legend than real now. 

The grandson is carrying on an affair with the wife of one of his fellow officers. Why was this scene included? It showed his naïveté and innocence. He was seduced. None of the Trotta men are natural with women. It’s paternal culture and women may represent change or an attack against tradition. Women are surprising absent from most of the book.

He accompanies his father on a trip to Vienna. They shop and the son is thrilled to get a cigarette case as a gift from his father. Along the way he finds out that the woman he slept with died. He feels tremendous grief and goes through some old letters of hers. His father’s friend, the one who painted a portrait of the grandfather, reappears. He seems to be a poor street artist now who has to ask them to help with his cigarettes. The father recalls that he had potential but became an alcoholic. I think the son suspects his father may be gay and had a relationship with the artist. He loves his father dearly and this is the first time he saw a vulnerable part to his dad. What’s the purpose of the artist? To contrast with the Trotta’s success? To the show the other path? Art, alcohol, etc.

The younger Trotta visits Sama, the widower. He returns with letters that are either meant for him or his father. Death is a major theme. The death of his former lover. He acknowledges that his father will die someday. He learns a lot from his father. For instance the elder Trotta tells him that when drinking brandy they only drink Hennessy.

Bus barracks extend into a Slavic town. The base signifies the empires strength over Slavic areas. Foreshadowing WW1’s trigger and what brought the empire down. He visits a brothel but isn’t interested in other women. He thinks about his Slavic roots often and how he’s come a long way from some Slovene village.

He steels a picture in brothel of the emperor, believing he was saving him like his grandfather. The army doctor doesn’t drink or enjoy himself at the brothel either. He didn’t come from a rich family and always wanted to be a doctor. His life was hard - a contrast to how Zweig describes the period in [[The World of Yesterday]]. That’s the difference between Vienna and the peripheral towns.

I think Trotta is having an affair with the doctor’s wife. I’m not sure why this is relevant. the surgeon says he warning him for his own sake. They walk through a cemetery and the surgeon remarks that they’re living off the dead. Trotta says he’s living off his grandfather. Trotta is happy to have a friend in the surgeon and it’s clear he doesn’t have that many. The surgeon has a beautiful wife who constantly cheats on him. When Trotta escorts his wife home, another man - Tattenbach - challenges the surgeon. The doctor (Dermant) objects and is called a yid and challenged to a duel. Per army requirements he had to go the duel though he knew he’d lose. 

The surgeon gets into a duel with its count Tattenbach over his wife and they both die. 
Some of this jives with Zweig’s description of sexual morality during this period. Everything was kept out of sight and the rules didn’t apply to the nobility.

Trotta went to see Dermant’s widow. I think she tried to seduce him. His father-in-law came home and wondered how this could happen in hyper rational and scientific Austria. Exactly as zweig had described Austria at the time. Obsessed with progress but with many things lurking underneath. Zweig talked about repressed sexual morality as well. The father-in-law mentioned a new constitution along with universal suffrage. These changes will show how much discontent there really is.  

Trotta transferred to another garrison at the border with Russia. There’s an uneasy coexistence right the Russians there. A polish person there remarked how the empire was destined to fall apart as soon as the Kaiser turned away. The Polish guy raised fears around the different ethnic groups and demands of the working class. Most dismiss this, but Trotta was already doubting the stability of the empire, partially due to deaths of his friends. Then his servant died and with it, his routine and sense of security. Every morning he woke up and expected the paper to be there. The break with his routine is foreshadowing turmoil in the kingdom.

The son is thinking about his father's mortality. He assumes he’ll be the last Trotta and hence the end of an era. When the father comes to visit, they meet a man who’s from the borderlands, might be Romanian. He isn’t deferent to the Kaiser and openly talks about the disintegration of the empire. He attributes it to God abandoning the kingdom and people choosing nationalism over the church. The district captain has resigned himself to the fact that the kingdom is falling apart. Between universal suffrage, and the expanding kingdom, it can’t continue. It was nice reading this the same time as Zweig’s book. He talks about the people’s hubris in thinking all could be fine even as they colonized more lands. He also talked about the lack of visible affection which is apparent in the relationship between the father and son. [[The World of Yesterday]]

A casino was opened at the frontier. Maybe this signifies how clueless and carefree the authorities. There’s also labour unrest as the people are fighting for equal rights. They want to avoid a revolution so they shoot first. It’s clear that if trust in the monarchy and God goes away, everything falls apart. Deep down, the Trottas know the whole thing is nonsense. They’re from the periphery as well and became nobility by pure chance. They have imposter syndrome which is also why they don’t want to let it go.

There’s an extended scene with Trotta and a captain at a newly opened casino. The captain is addicted to gambling and loses all of his money. Trotta sells his horse and lends the money to the captain which is also lost. I’m not sure what is the relevance of the scene. The degeneracy of the privileged class? A metaphor for other gambles they’re all taking?  

There was also an earlier scene with Trotta's father finding him drunk and warning him of the danger of alcohol. He reminds him of his childhood friend who painted the portrait of his grandfather and is now homeless. I’m not sure what the relevance of this scene either. 

He fell in love with a woman on the twin back to Vienna. He’s still in awe of the monarchy. He gets offended when she says he isn’t lucky and immediately heads to the casino where he wins repeatedly before a superior officer tells him to quit while ahead. He leaves and then regrets following orders. His obedience is another constant theme of the book and reminds me of Zweig again. The all trusting nature of the Austrian people pre-ww1 is apparent. The alcoholic painter makes another appearance and randomly meets Trotta in the street.

Trotta is sent to the borderlands to quell a labour rebellion. They’re singing the Internationale and marching. He orders his men to shoot and he kills several of them. He’s hospitalized after being hit by a rock. I’m reminded of the Jungle- many of the immigrants featured in that book came from this region of the world at this time - the end of the 19th century. Revolution was around the corner everywhere. The calm and the respect for authority was an illusion. [[The Jungle]]

The chapter on Franz Joseph was good and brought the theme of the book home. The Kaiser was well past his prime and all of his contemporaries were dead. He knew he was a joke to many and largely irrelevant but couldn’t let others know he knew. He mistook Trotta for his father (thought the hero was his father not Grandfather) and hadn’t realized how much time had passed. He envied ordinary soldiers but still thought his ascension was divine. His empire was collapsing and he was totally unfit to guide it. 
Trotta felt sorry for him when he saw him approaching.

Trotta is similar to the Kaiser. He’s growing senile and watching the world slip by. There’s a funny story how he was dissatisfied with all of the replacements for his dead butler as they refused to go by his name. He gets angry when young soldiers talk about boredom or money. Nationalism and minorities are foreign concepts to him. It’s always just been about the monarchy and he can’t imagine anything else. When his son tries to leave the army that’s the final straw. He realizes that his time has passed. The lieutenant is having an affair and trying to leave the army. He’s also still responsible for the captain's debts.
  
Trotta, the dad, is now appealing to the Kaiser for money, to save his son that is. The district leader and the Kaiser have become the same person - detached, senile, and forgetful. He asks the Kaiser to forgive his son which he does by deporting the captain and closing the casinos. A summer festival for the military is interrupted by news of the Assassination. This is indicative of how careless they all were. The war started and Trotta is seeing senseless violence around him. Peasants he used to know are found hanged to death. Different ominous birds show up. After he buries some hanging corpses he found, he’s shot and is killed.

He died holding buckets for cleaning up rather than with a gun. News of his death broke his fathers heart and shattered his life. He had no reason to live now and dies himself soon after. He seemed angry that the Kaiser should still be alive and thought he shouldn’t outlive the Trottas. Indeed the Kaiser soon died as did the empire. The passing of the Trottas coincided with that of the empire as Austria lost the war.
