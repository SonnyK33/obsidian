Descartes requestioning everything like the radical skeptics did. How do we know we’re not in a dream (the matrix asks this question). Or how do we know some evil force isn’t trying to deceive us into believing this is all reality. The fact that we’re thinking this through means we’re alive. That’s what it means to be alive.  

One biased thought can throw off a whole belief system so you should eliminate all of them. Strive for an unbiased belief system based on first principles 

The central debate was between rationalists (Descartes and others) and empiricists (Locke). Descartes set out to prove god's existence but not any one in particular. He wanted to show proof for a logical cause. If you live at a time when everyone believes in something, it may not be best use of time to try to prove them all wrong. It’s best to focus on other things if possible. 

He questions everything repeatedly until he arrives at an irrefutable truth. He realizes that even if everything is a dream or if some force is deceiving him, he’s still thinking. That means he exists. He starts from that first principle. From there he reasons that something must have created him. Something created him and something created that something, and so on. He calls this infinite being god. It’s the only way to reconcile the infinite loop. He uses this argument and Kant's ontolological one to prove gods existence.

God hence is infinite reality. Which he differentiates from objects which have finite reality. Real things like objects and god have formal reality while things in your head have objective reality. Only something infinite could put an infinite thought in to your head and so god must exist. 

The main counter arguments are:

Not everyone is born with the conception of an infinite being, only those born in his society. It's not clear why he separates formal and objective reality. The cartesian circle - he relies on existence of god to prove some evil force isn’t making everything seem real. But he’s trusting his thoughts, which could have been affected by that evil force.
