Foreign banks in the US are distinct in that they hold more reserves as a % of assets and they rely on MMF more than deposits.
When conditions get tighter (wider spread between EFFR and IOR), their reserves decrease as a %.

When reserves are ample, the EFFR trades below IOR. The Federal Home Loan Banks don't have access to the IOR and so they lend at EFFR. Banks can borrow at this rate and then earn IOR. Foreign banks are better positioned for this as they face fewer regulations. They aren't subject to the SLR and don't pay FDIC insurance fees. The foreign banks are hence the main users of this arbitrage. The more they use it, the narrower the spread gets. That's why lower reserves on their balance sheet corresponds to a wider spread. When reserves get scarce, private MM rates exceed IOR, and the arb goes away. Large banks may instead lend in the repo market when RRP exceed IOR. Scarce reserves can cause upside risks in MMF rates, like we saw in 9/19.
