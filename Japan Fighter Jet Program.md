The fighter jet program could create a new alliance between the UK and Japan. Japan is  working with the UK and Italy to develop a next gen fighter jet. It's a big deal as it doesn’t involve the US which had been its primary defense partner since WW2. It stems from Japan's  frustration with US not sharing sensitive info. The goal is obvs China related   
  
This also fits with Rudd's argument in [[The World According to Xi Jinping]] that the US' partners in Asia (Japan, Australia, etc) may not be getting the cooperation with the US that they desire. While Rudd paints Japan's foreign policy as being driven by desire to stand toe to toe with China while maintaining cordial relations, the FT piece widens the aperature a little. Japan may also want to move from under the US' thumb.
