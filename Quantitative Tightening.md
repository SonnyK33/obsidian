[[Reverse Repo Facility]]



Quantitative easing replaced treasuries with reserves on bank balance sheets and with bank deposits on non-bank balance sheets. Quantiative Tightening (QT) is the reverse of QE and aims to normalize the level of reserves in the system and reduce the size of the Fed's balance sheet. 

The Fed is implementing QT by letting its treasuries mature without rolling them over (except for when maturities are in excess of its QT cap). 

Liquidity could be drained from different places. The fed wants to shrink the balance sheet while  keeping liquidity in the banking sector above minimum threshold. This only works if most of the liquidity comes from the $2tr RRP facility. Hard


The mechanics across the relevant T-accounts are below:

**Fed**
It extinquishes reserves as the treasuries mature.
That is, rather than receiving cash, it deletes a reserve liability which was owed to the treasury. 

CR Treasury Asset
DR  Reserves

**Treasury**
Pays off the treasury with reserves on its balance sheet

CR Reserves to Fed
DR Treasury liability 

**Also issues new treasuries to an investor (since the Fed isn't rolling over its maturity) -** 

CR Treasury liability
DR Reserve asset (received from the commercial bank acting as an intermediary between the investor and treasury)

**Investor**
Purchases a new UST from the treasury and pays for it with a bank deposit. A commercial bank acts as an intermediary.

CR bank deposit asset
DR Treasury asset

**Commercial Bank**
Settles the transaction with reserves to the treasury
CR reserve asset (sends reserves to treasury so deducts its balance)
DR bank deposit liability 

**If the new treasury is purchased by an MMF who's withdrawing funds from the RRP facility** - 

Reserves in the banking sector are held constant, as new reserves are sent to the intermediary bank when settling the unwind of the RRP. MMFs could hence assist QT in being the incremental purchasers of new treasuries. If the incremental purchase comes from households that would be a net decrease in banking system reserves. Due to high fees being charged by MMFs and low deposit rates, many households are shifting to treasuries. This may mean the minimum level of reserves in the banking system may be hit sooner than thought (see: "trapped liquidity" link above).

**MMF**
CR RRP loan (an asset for the MMF)
DR Bank deposit (received a bank deposit)
CR Bank deposit (sends bank deposit to pay for new treasury)
DR Treasury asset

**Intermediary Bank**
CR bank deposit liability (owed to MMF)
DR Reserve asset (settled RRP unwind with Fed)
DR Bank deposit liability (for paying for new treasury)
CR Reserve asset (settles treasury purchase with Treasury)

MMFs have parked cash in the RRP rather than treasury bills as the returns have been higher. As of 12/20, the O/N reverse repo rate is 4.3% (https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/data-hub) versus 4.2% 3m t-bill rate. So effective QT, without draining the banking sector of adequate reserves, will require higher t-bill rates (or lower fed funds rates). Suggests that QT can only last a few months from here.




From GM23 podcast - 
The fed is reducing balance sheet by a third from 9.5tr and says that’s the equivalent of 25 bps - these guys think it’s actually 500bps and don’t think it’ll happen - thinks will crash system and pivot coming in early 2023

8–9 month lag between fed policy and change in market though is faster if returning funds to system that’s been deprived


Implications:
As reserves are drained from the banking sector, they have less liquidity to settle transactions and meet customer deposit withdrawals. The banks claim to have excess reserves, so this isn't expected to be a problem; however, in 2019 when this was last attempted, repo rates spiked. 
In a repo transaction, a bank lends cash to an investor and receives treasuries or some other security as collateral. If there is insufficient liquidity, banks would charge higher repo rates. 

The end of QE should mean higher long-term yields. This may make future issuance more weighted towards the shorter end of the curve. 

Investors holding more treasuries than bank deposits also means they'll be earning higher rates on their cash.
