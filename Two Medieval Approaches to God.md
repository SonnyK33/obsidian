[[The Anselm of Canterbury]]

Scholasticism is learning through reasoning like Socrates. St Aselm of Canterbury gave the  most famous proof of gods existence. Kant’s refutations were that existing in reality isn’t necessarily better than existing in your mind, and existing isn’t a quality like other traits.
I don’t understand this one. He says Anselm attaches the existence trait after the fact 
  
Moses Mimonetes Sees god in the Old Testament as a metaphor. You can say what god is not or can talk about what he does, not what he is.
