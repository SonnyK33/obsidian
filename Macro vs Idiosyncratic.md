It's important to break up the liquid credit universe into macro and idiosyncratic factors so that we're focusing on the right drivers for the given issuer and not duplicating trades. Now that we have a team, we can be systematic and cover more names, but we have to be efficient and ensure that time is being spent in the right areas. The lower you go on the ratings spectrum, the less macro catalysts matter



Start by breaking down the universe into sectors and separating macro from idiosyncratic factors. For macro trades, the research team can add value by determining if a single name makes sense if:
1) Lower attachment point - leverage (financial or operational), poorer customers, regulatory differences (e.g. variable rate mortgages in Canada), more discretionary (e.g. luxury spending)
2) More asymmetric outcome if attachment point is hit - deeply subordinated, lack of hard assets, messy capital structure/legal process, lack of market access (e.g. EM corporate operating in challenging region)

Idiosyncratic can be broken into:
1) Changes to capital allocation
2) Shrinking markets
3) Industry changes - e.g. consolidation 
4) Management execution - competitive landscape, product mix, etc
5) LME/capital structure catalysts 

Whether it's a macro or idiosyncratic trade will also determine what work the research team will need to focus on. For macro trades, we'll differentiate issuers on the basis of leverage (financial and operational), end customers, nature of spend (i.e. discretionary or staple), and recovery/downside.

For idiosyncratic, the focus will be on capital allocation (does management need to grow with capex or M&A, are shareholder returns necessary to boost the stock price), industry catalysts,  management's execution (competition, shifting customer preferences, etc), and capital structure catalysts. 

From idiosyncratic bucket, can identify questions that are common across multiple issuers and even sectors:
1) consumer spending on leisure
2) priming capacity
3) fiber spend
4) spectrum valuation 


This should avoid pure "value" trades without identifying a catalyst.
