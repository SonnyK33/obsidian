Find your edge - [https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=c1VAqJv1p4s](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=c1VAqJv1p4s)

Summary - Lebron distilled his rules of trading into 10 rules. Many of the lessons reminded me [[Superforecasting]]; they emphasized systematic thinking and humility, as well as regulating system 1 and 2 thinking. The biggest takeaway for me was finding your edge, and how it relates to storytelling. The best edges are not contingent and don't rely on complicated math or statistics. You should be able to tell a story. Your models should flow from, and reinforce your edge. So if my edge is distilling trades into a few questions, and grouping them with other trades, my models should flow from those questions. 

The goal of your model is to tell you whether a trade will work or not. The first stage is coming up with the questions and the required information. It should lay out what would be needed to come up with the opposite trade. The financial model is just a subset of your overall model for decision making. Predicting EBITDA or FCF is just a means to and end. The end goal is to predict prices. Your model should layout different price possibilities and what catalyst path could lead to each. Why do you think it'll take a certain path?

**AroundTown REIT example**
1) What are the possibilities for the perp prices?
2) what paths would lead to each?
	1) A bullish path would be an asset sale or a secured deal to take out perps?
	2) What's needed to go down these paths?

Forecasting NOI and LTV may be necessary for completeness, but is not really part of the "model". 

What loops are you betting on? Is this a momentum strategy? That is, one where as the price moves in your direction, it becomes a better trade? Or the opposite?

For the REIT perps, it's a momentum strategy. 

Chapter 1 - Motivation

We're guilty of oscillating between fear and greed. We need to be aware of biases and train our emotions. Slot machines take advantage of compulsive gamblers who aren’t chasing money but a feeling of being in the zone. You need to find your risk tolerance set point, that is, where are you comfortable. Some bets look better, and so you fool your system 1 (heuristic model). We overvalue the big win and ignore the more likely small costs (like paying carry for a convex short). It's the same logic for why options tend to be overpriced. Optionality is important, but don't overpay for it. Understand why you are trading and whether or not it's for profit maximization. For me it’s to better understand the world; this is an important distinction. I tend to go down rabbit holes if I think something is interesting. Be aware of your flaws and your motivations. 

Strive to have a small self image. That is, a simple way of defining why you are trading. Write down motivations for a trade beforehand with a decision tree in place. What would cause you to change your mind. Pre-commit to certain decisions and to desirable actions. External motivators will only work in the short term. 

The book is fundamentally about rational decision making. We make trades all day, apart from those we put on in our day job. Every decision we make can be considered a trade. We need these laws because of emotional decision making. We tend to overestimate our abilities and underestimate certain events.  


Chapter 2 - Adverse Selection

*Bayesian reasoning and updating* 
A market maker should update his market based on others. If another makes a tighter market at a lower price they’re more confident and you should adjust accordingly. Unexpected events e.g. a special dividend can make this process harder. Is the other trader adjusting for the event correctly? Are you? Adverse selection explains why we always wish we traded more or less than what we did. Don’t trade with people who can change the rules e.g. large owners of a distressed bond who can force an uptiering. The winners curse is that the winner of an auction likely overpaid. You should compensate for this by paying less than what it’s worth, i.e. give yourself a margin of safety. Should be obvious but we don’t always do that.

Chapter 3 - Risk

Take risks you’re paid to take and hedge the rest. Think of your portfolio as self financing; that is, take into account the cost of capital. Don’t rely on just one risk measure. What risks are you taking in a given trade? Which ones represent your edge? You should hedge the rest. Is the risk issuer-specific or market beta? If it’s the latter, maybe should own index instead. The risk you’re taking should line up with your edge. If you're making a market and trading something in a range you’re just selling volatility. That’s the risk you’re getting paid for. This is why we can’t trade MCBRAC like that. Make sure to not underestimate worse case scenarios.

Chapter 4 - Liquidity

Choose the most liquid way to take a risk. Assess all the ways you could express a position: stock, future, ETF, call, or selling put. You can compare them on bid ask spread, the quantity needed for target PnL, depth of market, the likelihood your trade moves the market, and specificity (how close is your trade to the risk you want). For example, an ETF to bet on earnings of a given company wins on liquidity but loses on size requirement and specificity. An index could make sense if you think the positive earnings will reflect on the whole sector. Liquidity matters outside financial markets as well, for example gym contracts vs paying per service. If you're dealing with an illiquid product, expand the search space into other geographies. That’s how Amazon created a market for everything - by selling globally - it’s profitable even for niche items. The analogue to credit is we need to be active across all sectors, and most geographies.  

Chapter 5 - Edge

Your edge is why a trade will make money repeatedly. If you can’t explain it in 5 min you don’t have it. It means you know something or can do something that the marginal trader can’t. You don’t have to know more than everyone just the marginal player. You need to be better than median trader. Your edge is the story you tell for why a trade works. It shouldn’t rely on math and logic, which are are hampered by illusion of concreteness and certainty. A true edge requires storytelling. You need to overcome biases when assessing edge. Assume you’re being overconfident when thinking you know something others don’t. Avoid confirmation bias by looking for things that go against your view. Try to come up with the opposite trade. What would you need to completely change your view? You need to develop processes that lead to robust and believable stories for your trades. Creativity is important, as obvious ideas won’t work. The best  ideas seem half bad initially; that's another way of saying you need to take actual risk that you’ll be wrong. How much are you willing to lose on a trade? Think of your target PnL, how many trade ideas exist, how long it takes to come up with your trades. Be persistent but not stubborn. The story you’re telling for this trade needs to interact with other stories for other trades. A good story should upend some beliefs. If it’s consistent with everything you believe, is it a new idea? If this story is true, where else should you see it?  For example, how does the Enova Algo work? Are my predictions around lending into a deteriorating market true? What new belief am I forming?  

The more trades, the better. You should maintain a list of paper trades and track results, including new issues. Include the thesis and update with results. Examples of edge are getting paid to provide liquidity, arbing things deviating from trends like off the run vs new treasuries. The simplest stories are robust. A complex edge with moving parts won’t be broadly applicable and will fade. You can’t build a business on fleeting over-complicated and contingent edges/opportunities. Edges will tend to fade over time, possibly due to regulatory or other changes. The best businesses have edge e.g. Apple with product design and the ecosystem. What’s your personal edge? This should be easy to explain and not contingent. You may need experimentation to find it.

Chapter 6 - Models

If you think world is unknowable, you want a phenomenological model that relies on empirical observations rather than any overarching theory. You can make changes to it and figure out when it works and when it doesn’t. Money tends to be made when the model breaks down. You should know your edge before making a model. Your model should help tell your story, but you should avoid models in search of an edge. Rather your edge should inform the model which in turn helps refine edge/story. Both of them should adapt together. The model should express the edge you identified. It should be robust and adapt to new information, in accordance with your stated edge. Your edge will change over time; you need to think about why. What’s changed? Maybe just model parameters have changed. What are the feedback loops which will result on large moves from small changes? 

Your models for people should understand their motivations and empathize with their views rather than phenomenological models which don't attempt to understand phenomena. 

Chapter 7 - Costs and Capacity
Chapter 8 - Possibility


  

If your edge doesn’t have real costs it isn’t real edge. We need to breaks costs into 4 groups. Whether the costs are visible and whether they're linear. You should depreciate costs not yet realized like a dissipating edge. Herding costs are invisible and non linear. How many people are doing same thing as you. They’ll all sell same time as you and exacerbate flows. If trades seems too easy probably, you're probably underestimating the costs. Is it executable in size? How quickly will it be replicated? 

Impossible events can still occur. Traders require induction to operate, and so they rely on patterns. You need to understand why patterns exist and what could change them. 
Understand the feedback loops, and differentiate impossible from physically possible but very unlikely. Balancing or negative loops correspond to mean reversion or market making strategies. Reinforcing or positive loops match momentum strategies. Both are present in many trades just for different people and at different timescales. When a market maker goes short to sell a HF shares the former is betting on reversion and the latter on a positive loop. Which dominates? Refer to [[Thinking in Systems]]

The housing market in 2008 an example of loops in both directions. More lending increased prices which led to more lending. When rates increases and defaults ticked up, prices fell and the opposite loop occurred. Loop required low correlations to remain in place. Even small correlations between different events can make an unlikely event more probable. If odds of two events are 1/1000 and they’re independent, the odds of both are 1/1m. But if the correlation is 0.1 odds of both are 1/10k. You need to get better at estimating probabilities. 
Calibrate by comparing with other events like rolling a die. This point is made in [[Superforecasting]] repeatedly. Compare the likelihood of some event you’re predicting with rolling a number; which would surprise you more? Bet small amounts on these events to further sharpen estimate; would you take the bet ? What would you need to take it? 

When you require certain events not occur that induces them to occur. Small correlations are important. 

Chapter 9 - Alignment
When hiring, I need to think about aligned incentives. Managers choose riskier investments because the don’t lose capital when wrong. 

Chapter 10 - Technology
Chapter 11 - Adaptation

We can automate the repetitive, but we still need humans to understand context. We need both. Changing regulatory conditions will give new trading opportunities and learning from trades will open up others. In that way good trades lead to others and are evolutionary.
  

Lessons

1) know your motivation 

2) be better than the marginal trader not all traders

3) understand the risks your trades expose you too

4) understand how liquidity shifts change your trades. Act before change occurs.  

5) understand your edge. It will degrade so must adapt and find new ones

6) understand the type of model you’re making and how it corresponds to your edge. Over time what degrades? Understand how and why both decay and which is the source

7) what are your trades’ cost and how do they prevent competition? How do they change? Think about the research process you’re leading here - how is it different from others

8) impossible can happen. What are the feedback loops in play? Correlations?

9) align incentives across team and have a clear structure

10) take advantage of new data 


Strive to continually improve. There should be less hierarchy when you need creative outputs. Hierarchy is helpful when we want to remove arbitrariness and stick to a procedure, i.e. for types of trades. Traders are paid to adapt and continually find new edges. By their nature all edges fade, so evolution is key.
