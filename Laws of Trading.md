Find your edge - [https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=c1VAqJv1p4s](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=c1VAqJv1p4s)

Summary - Lebron distilled his rules of trading into 10 rules. Many of the lessons reminded me [[Superforecasting]]; they emphasized systematic thinking and humility, as well as regulating system 1 and 2 thinking. 



Chapter 1 - Motivation

We're guilty of oscillating between fear and greed. We need to be aware of biases and train our emotions. Slot machines take advantage of compulsive gamblers who aren’t chasing money but a feeling of being in the zone. You need to find your risk tolerance set point, that is, where are you comfortable. Some bets look better, and so you fool your system 1 (heuristic model). We overvalue the big win and ignore the more likely small costs (like paying carry for a convex short). It's the same logic for why options tend to be overpriced. Optionality is important, but don't overpay for it. Understand why you are trading and whether or not it's for profit maximization. For me it’s to better understand the world; this is an important distinction. I tend to go down rabbit holes if I think something is interesting. Be aware of your flaws and your motivations. 

Strive to have a small self image. That is, a simple way of defining why you are trading. Write down motivations for a trade beforehand with a decision tree in place. What would cause you to change your mind. Pre-committ to certain decisions and to desirable actions. External motivators will only work in the short term. 


Chapter 2 - Adverse Selection
Chapter 3 - Risk
Chapter 4 - Liquidity
Chapter 5 - Edge
Chapter 6 - Models
Chapter 7 - Costs and Capacity
Chapter 8 - Possibility
Chapter 9 - Alignment
Chapter 10 - Technology
Chapter 11 - Adaptation

The book is fundamentally about rational decision making. We make trades all day, apart from those we put on in our day job. Every decision we make can be considered a trade. We need these laws because of emotional decision making. We tend to overestimate our abilities and underestimate certain events. 
  

Chapter 2

Bayesian reasoning and updating - market maker should update his market based on others. If another makes a tighter market at a lower price they’re more confident and you should adjust accordingly. Check his example.

  

Unexpected events eg a special dividend can make this process harder. Is the other trader adjusting for the event correctly? Are you?

  

Adverse selection - explains why we always wish we traded more or less than what we did. Don’t trade w ppl who can change the rules eg large owners of a distressed bond who can force an uptiering. 

  

Winners curse - the winner of an auction likely overpaid. Compensate for this by paying less than what it’s worth. Should be obvious but we don’t always do that.

Chapter 3

Take risks you’re paid to take and hedge the rest

Think of your portfolio as self financing that is take into account the cost of capital

Don’t rely on just one risk measure

What risks are you taking in a given trade? Which ones represent your edge? Should

Hedge the rest.

Ie is it issuer specific or market beta? If it’s the latter, maybe should own index instead.

The risk you’re taking should line up with your edge.

If your making a market and trading something in a range you’re just selling volatility.

That’s the risk you’re getting paid for. This is why we can’t trade MCBRAC like that

  

Don’t underestimate worse case scenarios

Chapter 4 liquidity

Choose the most liquid way to take a risk 

Assess all the ways you could express a position - stock, future, etf, call, or selling put

Compare on bid ask spread, quantity needed for target PnL, depth of market and likelihood your trade moves the market, and specificity -

How close is your trade to the risk you want 

Eg an etf to bet on earnings of a given company wins on liquidity but loses on size requirement and specificity

An index could make sense if you think the positive earnings will reflect on the whole sector

  

Liquidity matters outside financial markets 

Eg gym contracts vs paying for service

If dealing with an illiquid product, expand search space into other geographies 

That’s how Amazon created a market for everything - by selling globally - it’s profitable even for niche items 

  

Chapter 5 edge

Edge is why a trade will make money repeatedly 

If you can’t explain in 5 min you don’t have it 

  

Means you know something or can do something that the marginal trader can’t 

You don’t have to know more than everyone just the marginal player

You need to be better than median trader

Edge is the story you tell for why a trade works - shouldn’t rely on math and logic - that may give further evidence but is hampered by illusion of concreteness and certainty 

True edge requires storytelling 

  

Overcoming biases when assessing edge

Assume you’re being over confident when thinking you know something others don’t

Confirmation bias - look for things that go against your view 

  

Need to develop processes that lead to robust and believable stories for your trades

Creativity - obvious ideas won’t work, good ideas seem half bad initially - another way of saying you need to take actual risk that you’ll be wrong

How much are you willing to lose on a trade? Think of your target PnL, how many trade ideas exist, how long it takes to come up w your trades

Be persistent- but not stubborn

The story you’re telling for this trade - how does it fit with other Stories for other trades?

A good story should upend some beliefs 

If it’s consistent with everything you believe, is it a new idea?

If this story is true, where else should you see it?

How does enova Algo work? Are my predictions around lending into a deteriorating market true?

  

More trades are better - you should maintain list of paper trades and track results 

Including new issues 

Include thesis and update w results 

Examples of edge - getting paid to provide liquidity, arbing things deviating from trends like off the run vs new treasuries 

  

Simple stories are robust

Complex edge w moving parts won’t be broadly applicable and will fade 

Can’t build a business on fleeting over complicated and contingent edges/opportunities 

  

Edge will tend to fade over time 

Possibly due to regulatory or other changes 

Businesses have edge eg apple

What’s your personal edge? Should be easy to explain and not contingent 

May need experimentation to find it

Chap 6 models

If think world is unknowable, want a phenomological sp? Model and make changes to it, figure out when it works and when it doesn’t 

  

Money to be made when model breaks down 

Know edge before making model

Model should help tell your story

Avoid models in search of an edge

Rather edge should inform model which in turn helps refine edge/story - both should adapt together. Model should express the edge you identified. It should be robust and adapt to new information, in accordance w states edge.

Edge will change over time - think about why

What’s changed? Maybe just model parameters have changed 

What are the feedback loops which will result on large moves from small changes

Want to use G models for other ppl 

Understand their motivations and empathize w

Them

Rather than P models 

Chap 7 costs

  

If your edge doesn’t have real costs it isn’t real edge

Breaks costs into 4 groups

Whether visible and whether linear

Should depreciate costs not yet realized like a dissipating edge

Herding cost is an invisible and non linear cost

How many ppl are doing same thing as you 

They’ll all sell same time as you

If trades seems too easy probably underestimating the costs

Is it executable in size ? How quickly will it be replicated?

Impossible events can still occur

Traders require induction to operate

And so rely on patterns 

Need to understand why patterns exist and what could

Change them 

Understand the feedback loops 

Differentiate impossible from physically possible but very unlikely

Balancing or negative loops correspond to mean reversion or market making strategies 

Reinforcing or positive match momentum strategies 

  

Both are present in many trades just for different ppl and at different timescales

When a market maker goes short to sell a HF shares the former is betting on reversion and the latter on a positive loop 

Which dominates?

Housing market in 2008 an example of

Loops in both directions

More lending increased prices which led to more lending 

When rates increases and defaults ticked up,

Prices fell and the opposite loop occurred 

Loop required low correlations to remain in place

Even small correlations between different events can make an unlikely event more probable 

If odds of two events are 1/1000 and they’re indep odds of both are 1/1m

But if correlation is 0.1 odds of both are 1/10k

Get better at estimating probabilities 

Calibrate by comparing w other events like rolling a die 

Compare likelihood of some event you’re predicting w rolling a number - which would surprise you more

Bet small amounts on these events to further sharpen estimate - would you take the bet ? What would you need to take it?

When you require certain events not occur that induces them

To occur

Small correlations are important

When hiring need for I think about and align incentives 

Managers choose riskier investments bc don’t lose capital when wrong

Automate the repetitive but still need humans to understand context

Need both

Changing regulatory conditions will give new trading opportunities and learning from trades will open up others. In that way good trades lead to others and are evolutionary 

  

Lessons

1) know your motivation 

2) be better than the marginal trader not all traders

3) understand the risks your trades expose you too

4) understand how liquidity shifts change your trades. Act before change 

5) understand your edge. It will degrade so must adapt and find new ones

6) understand the type of model you’re making and how it corresponds to your edge. Over time what degrades? Understand how and why both decay and which is the source

7) what are your trades’ cost and how do they prevent competition? How do they change? Think about the research process you’re leading here - how is it different from others

8) impossible can happen. What are the feedback loops in play? Correlations?

9) align incentives across team and have a clear structure

10) take advantage of new data 

  

Strive to continually improve

Should be less hierarchy when need creative outputs

 Hierarchy is helpful when want to remove arbitrariness and stick to a procedure

Ie for types of trades

Traders are paid to adapt and continually find new edges 

By their nature all edges fade

So evolution is key
