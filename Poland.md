GS EM Starts | Comparing inflation dynamics across EM 00- 11.25.22

- Poland's inflation and fiscal deficits likely to get worse due to the influx of refugees from Ukraine and the impulse to spend more on defense. They have a CA deficit of 4% and want to increase defense spending by 2.6% of GDP (currently 2.5%). Inflation is ~20%, and the central bank hasn't been sufficiently hawkish to take care of inflation. The weak economy is preving the central bank from hiking further. 
- inflation has been muted by subsidies - would be 400 bps higher without the price caps 
- these subsidies have had a fiscal cost and likely can't continue next year
	- there's an election next Oct, so subsidies may continue till then 
	- but if subsidies are weakened throughout the year, will require central bank to become more hawkish
