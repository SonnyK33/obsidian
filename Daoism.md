Arose during the disintegration of a dynasty in China, the Warring States period. There was a need for a code of morality. 100 schools were created, including Daoism and Confucionism.  

Dao means a path or a journey. A tranquil path that we should follow to be in synchronized with nature. It could also be interpreted as a blank space. A void that existed before the universe. Most traditions and religion push you against the dao (this was the opposite thinking of Confucianism which revered tradition). 

One should instread practice Wu Wei - go with the flow, be like water. Don’t push the boulder but slowly erode it like water. Go through the cracks.  

The Founder, Lao something, may have been a group of people. The author  remembers him as a lazy hippy. The second major contributor, Juang Xi,  wrote during the warring states period. Some say he was against the endless pursuit of knowledge because that’s a futile task. Others say he was against always looking for something. He was against government control and had some leanings of anarchism. 

Believed in "live and let live", be like water. This is closely related to the ying Yang. Wuwei was to maintain ying yang, which was all about similarity of opposites. This was analogous to heroclitias' theory of flux. [[Pre-socratic]]

Ying yanh had a major impact on Chinese philosophy but flux had little impact on the west.
