[[Kelton - How Should We Think About Fiscal Sustainability]]

The quantity of financial capital supplied must equal the quantity demanded. 

Supplied financial capital is total savings plus capital from abroad. Capital from abroad will equal the trade deficit. If you're importing more than you're exporting, net capital must be entering the country to finance the gap. Capital from abroad means foreigners owning domestic assets. If foreigners own domestic assets (on a net basis) , you must have acquired foreign goods on the other side of that. So capital from abroad implies an equivalent trade deficit. 

Demanded financial capital is equal to investment plus government deficits.  

supply = S + (M-X)  
demand = I + (G-T)
  
These must equal: S + (M-X) = I + (G-T)  

Domestic savings are always part of the supply of capital, and domestic investment is always part of the demand for capital. The fiscal and trade balances can move to either side depending on their sign.   

The trade deficit is hence determined by the savings balance.  

M - X = (I - S) - (T - G)

deficit = investment - private savings - government savings   

Investment can only exceed savings if dollars are coming from outside the country. 

I - S - (T - G) = M - X  

If there's a surge in investment opportunities (e.g. tech in late 90s or shale in 2010s), if savings are held constant (i.e. consumption patterns don't change, and fiscal deficit stays the same), the difference will come from abroad. You would expect interest rates and the dollar to rise, drawing in foreign capital. Rather than purchasing US exports, foreigners would prefer buying USD to finance US investments. Hence it would lead to a larger trade deficit.   

If savings decrease but investment stays constant, that means consumption will increase. If the fiscal balance stays the same, it implies that the trade deficit would increase. This makes sense as higher consumption means higher imports. Pettis' argument is that if savings are forced down, while investment from abroad stays constant (due to a flight to the safety of UST), that forces investment to decrease. A trade deficit forces either savings to decrease or investment to increase. Whether there are ample investment opportunities will determine which one prevails. Government borrowing could also absorb the capital inflows.  

If the budget deficit rises while investment and private savings stays constant, that will force the trade deficit higher as well. The higher government spending will require foreigners to purchase more treasuries and fewer exports.

Savings-investment balance is closely related to a country's balance of payments. Savings versus consumption is a policy choice and will determine a country's development or growth model. 

How does the trade balance fit into GDP? 
Where do exports "show up"? In investment or savings?


**Case Studies**
*China*
Pettis argues that in order for China to shift towards a consumption model, they'll either have to shift national wealth to consumers and away from businesses or the government (who have a lower propensity to consume). This would require either widespread privatizations or ending the subsidies to businesses and allow wage growth to keep up with productivity. The currency will also have to appreciate (benefits consumers who import over businesses who export)  and interest rates will have to rise. (Not sure why higher interest rates will shift income to consumers - is that just because they currently have such high levels of savings?)
