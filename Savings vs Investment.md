[[Trade Wars are Class Wars]]

Savings-investment balance is closely related to a country's balance of payments. Savings versus consumption is a policy choice and will determine a country's development or growth model. 

How does the trade balance fit into GDP? 
Where do exports "show up"? In investment or savings?


**Case Studies**
*China*
Pettis argues that in order for China to shift towards a consumption model, they'll either have to shift national wealth to consumers and away from businesses or the government (who have a lower propensity to consume). This would require either widespread privatizations or ending the subsidies to businesses and allow wage growth to keep up with productivity. The currency will also have to appreciate (benefits consumers who import over businesses who export)  and interest rates will have to rise. (Not sure why higher interest rates will shift income to consumers - is that just because they currently have such high levels of savings?)
