Monetarists, formulated by Milton Friedman, argue that central banks can best affect national output and inflation through changes to the money supply. The theory holds that inflation is caused by excess money supply and that central bank authorities should focus solely on maintaining price stability. 

Monetarists believe monetary policy is more effective than fiscal. Using the IS/LM model, the IS curve is flatter (more elastic) and the LM curve is vertical (inelastic). A shift in the money supply, moves the LM curve to the right.
