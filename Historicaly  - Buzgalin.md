Buzgalin argues that the Maidan Revolution and removal of Yanukovuch were wrong as the forced were infilterated with far-right forces, including neo-nazis. There is ample support for this. I think it's legitimate to point out if a protest has been hijacked by outside, well-funded forces, and that does take away some validity of the protests. I'm less convinced by the argument that an extra-judicial removal is okay if done by progressive forces. This is obviously a slipperly slope. Every situation is different; if a majoritorian government becomes a fascist one, there may be no other option than for the agrieved minority to rise up. In most cases though, the events are being controlled by powerful forces - many times, foreign forces. I think the situation must be exceptionally dire for it to be permissible for a group to remove the government outside of a constitutional process. The bar is even higher if it receives. assistance from a foreign government (which benefits from the removal or may have contributed to the conflict in the first place - like in Maidan).

Ukraine has been a part of Russia since mid  the 17th century. It joined Russia at Ukraine’s request. They had no national rights under the Tsars. After the Russian Revolution, in the 1920s, the Bolsheviks wanted to make Donbas part of Ukrainian republic within the USSR as they wanted to united industrial and agrarian workers. Because Ukraine was mainly agrarian,  uniting it with the Donbas was done for political reasons rather than due to any cultural ties.

He sees WW2 as a  war between all of Europe and the Soviet Union. For example, 1mm French joined the anti-Bolshevik league. Bandera was Ukrainian nationalist who sided with Hitler because he promised support for an independent Ukraine though that was insincere. He was harsher on Jews and communists than on Nazis.

Crimea joined Ukraine under Kruschev in the 1960s. Half of Ukrainians speak Russian - most of these people also speak Ukrainian.  Ukraine's ties to Russia started to fade post-indepenence. In last 30 yrs Russia has grown 1pct/a and Ukraine is even worse. In 1999, 
Ukraine GDP fell 50pct, and they needed an IMF bailout. Russia did slightly better off as it had oil. Two million Ukrainians are working in Russia (when?) as they had better employment prospects.Economic elites became more anti-Russian as that was best way to get economic power under the new market reforms (i.e. to win favour with the US.)   

Russia in late 90s became under control of private capital. That’s still the case, but the state bureaucracy is now very powerful and has ultimate control. This is less so the case in Ukraine which has more disorder.

Yanukovuch was from Donbas and had business ties with Russia, and so had reasons to favor stronger ties with Russia. That doesn't mean there weren't legitimate political and economic reasons to do so. The Maidan protests started with  ordinary people who were protesting against corruption and inequality, and some of them blamed Russia for this. But it also had Nazi and far right liberal western support.  

Whether the removal of Yanukovuch was legal or not isn’t important. Progressive may  overthrow a fascist government which should be welcomed. What matters is who the coup supporters are - In this case, it was nazis.
