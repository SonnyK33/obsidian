Satre's take on the Electra myth has Zeus arguing that leaders should share in their people's grief. This is especially true when the people feel guilty for a collective crime. This rings true today. In the US for example, most are aware of the country's past crimes even if they choose to look past them. The last thing they want though, is a leader who comes from somewhere else and reminds them of past failings. This reminded me of the republican strategy against President Obama.
