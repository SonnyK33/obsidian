Short horizons have the fattest tails and so short-term options may give disproportionate upside. Historically short term vol was expensive leading to institutional products selling it.
Now there are few natural buyers for short term vol (2wks or less) or long term (2-3 yrs).

Selling an OTM put is very different from leaving a limit order. If the stock hits the strike you’ll have a MTM loss on the put and only make it back if stock comes back. You're actually giving up the ability to buy the stock at a lower price without having lost something (ie on the put).  

**Jumpy Volatility**

Hard to make money buy just selling options where IV is higher than RV - market has gotten more efficient but also much more jumpy. Vol regime jumpy due to dealer positioning and gamma acting as an accelerant. Rather than forecasting vol, one should spend time thinking of probabilit of elevated spike in vol, or what would create a spike. Look at divergences in close to close, volumes,  and intraday not smooth changes in vol. 
  
Changes in liquidity caused by banks pulling back post Dodd frank part of the issue. Because of all of the option selling by retail, dealers are long gamma. That means their delta hedging dampens market moves in both directions when close to strike prices. You see this in low realized close to close vol, but gamma decreases sharply as you move away from strikes, so this phenomenon only lasts when close to strikes. When you break away, the relationship changes.

If you believe everyone is long gamma and there will be resistance to moves, you will delta hedge more aggressively intraday after a gap happens. If you think you're moving close to a negative gamma zone, you may want to hedge at close. When you move past local ranges, CTAs can push much further and exaggerate move. Eg in March 2020, banks sold variance swaps and so were negative gamma.  

In dec 2021 Vix spiked as ppl were buying 10d puts just to get through year end and there was limited liquidity for tail hedges at the end of the year. That spike in vol at year end will dissipate soon.

**Correlation**
[[Credit Correlation]]
Correlations don’t necessarily go to 1 in a crisis esp through the period. In 2008 there were major factor swings eg between financials and energy that led to dispersion intraperiod. 

With single name vol rising due to options, dispersion has also increased. Ben's fund looks at spread between weighted average vol of index members and index vol (which is more market neutral) vs implied correlation which goes up when vol goes up. In 2017-19, single name vol was low relative to index implying higher correlation. In 2020 there was a lot more retail trading options which increases single name vol and implied lower correlation despite crisis nature of 2020.  

In 2008, market neutral hedge ratio short correlation did well due to factor rotation. Theta neutral which would’ve meant short tails and short a lot of index would’ve done poorly. Index would have more theta (I think) because traded higher due to higher IV. The higher IV was due to the assumed correlation. Theta neutral would have required you to be short more index. Index was probably the first to move which is why this trade may have done poorly.   

A dispersion trade that’s delta hedging everyday will capture intraday dispersion even if correlations rising close to close. It will capture the de-correlation that happens along the path even if all stocks are down 50pct at the end of the period.

**Trade Construction**

Sizing should be proportional to risk/reward and correlation with rest of portfolio. For cross asset RV, you need to be careful with basis risk and ensure the other leg does actually reduce risk. Vol across different markets may not correlate for a long time.
Eg in dec 2018, equity vol in the US moved much more than other markets and skew came down. 

**Rate vol**

First thing to ask in any market is who buys and sells these products for what purpose and in what size. In 10y note futures tends to be one asset manager who’s a big seller of 2-3 month vol. 

**Formosa issuances**
(don't understand this)
Insurance companies have demand for long term callable options which depresses swaption vol (bonds are short the call). Long term forward rate vol is inverted giving mild positive carry.
That is, long term vol is lower because of the demand for the callable bonds. Inverted vol curve will be positive carry - roll up the curve. Carry can increase in times of crisis or a big enough rate move but then reverses because of so much supply
