8am/Opening thoughts
Stocks are up 1% and have breached 4000. The long bond is up ~1pt and oil is down. Market is still digesting the CPI miss and is strong on combination of pivot hopes, more sovereign support in China, and a possible ceasefire in Russia. There's only one more week of real supply before Thanksgiving, and then liquidity dries up. Stocks have overshot, but could continue until the 200dma (~4078). Long rates (short-end first) makes sense here
