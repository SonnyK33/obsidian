**2023 Price Dynamics**
convergence to international [[Commodities Note]]

- high international pricing is part of the bullish outlook, but export capacity will limit any international convergence
	- European prices are at $40/mmbtu
	- LNG export capacity is contracted and takes time to build
	- restart of Freeport facility will bring back 2 bcf/day of export capacity which could help market in mid-23
	- after that, meaningful export capacity not coming till 2024
	- days of inventory cover (while still at a deficit) has recovered, and prices are at the high end for this level of deficit 
- gas prices are well above US and global supply curves (see Barclays note)
	- at 99th percentile, so all production is economical and can expect supply to continue
- storage levels are back to 5 year average after downtime at Freeport LNG export facility

**Trades**
- EQT could be short as a pure play gas producer and has been spending on M&A
- one of the few energy credits w/ leverage above its target
- needs $4.75 gas to meet deleveraging targets, that's before share buybacks
