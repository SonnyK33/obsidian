The Soros Imperial Dollar explains why Japan can't grow its capital account surplus any further. It'll lead to a cheaper JPY and protests from the US. Germany can get away with this due to the Eurozone.

The "Imperial Dollar" was first coined by Soros in 1994. As he explained it, Reagan wished to increase defense spending without increasing taxes. The higher fiscal deficit raised the real interest rate which pulled in more foreign inflows and strengthened the dollar. The stronger dollar led to more imports and worsened the current account deficit. However, the stronger dollar kept inflation low. This in turn led to more inflows. This ended with the Plaza Accord with Japan. The USD appreciated by 50% against Japan, Germany, France, and the UK. Eventually, the current account deficit became too much for the manufacturing sector, leading to protectionism. The imperial dollar 2.0 is driven by the dollar's impact on global trade and commodities. A stronger dollar slows down global trade and lowers commodity prices. Since the US is less exposed to trade than other countries, more funds flow into USD. This reinforces the cycle. This is driven by an inconsistency in global commerce. While the dollar has become more dominant in global trade trade, the US economy has shrunk as percentage of global GDP and trade. The US has a more service oriented economy and is much less exposed to exports than the rest of the world (10% vs 50% for Europe and 20% for China).

The US is the main global destination for capital flows. It has the capacity to absorb the world's excess savings, particularly from Asia which has a shortage of investable assets. The IMF estimated that life insurers' assets in Asia are >10x the domestic corproate bond market. The global excess savings mainly come from East Asia and are the result of policy choices. Since the Asian Financial Crisis, emerging Asian countries have chosen to accumulate excess reserves, most of which are directed to the US. FX reserves to GDP went from 14% to 52% from 1980-22.

Most trade is invoiced in dollars, and more importantly, the dollar plays a major role in working capital needs for supply chains. Global supply chains are credit intensive and  rely on dollar financing for trade finance and working capital funding. Tighter US monetary policy (relative to the rest of the world) or a global crisis could trigger the cycle.
