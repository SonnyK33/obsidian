The Soros Imperial Dollar explains why Japan can't grow its capital account surplus any further. It'll lead to a cheaper JPY and protests from the US. Germany can get away with this due to the Eurozone. 


The "Imperial Dollar" was first coined by Soros in 1994. As he explained it, Reagan wished to increase defense spending without increasing taxes. The higher fiscal deficit raised the real interest rate which pulled in more foreign inflows and strengthened the dollar. The stronger dollar led to more imports and worsened the current account deficit. However, the stronger dollar kept inflation low. This in turn led to more inflows. This ended with the Plaza Accord with Japan. The USD appreciated by 50% against Japan, Germany, France, and the UK. Eventually, the current account deficit became too much for the manufacturing sector, leading to protectionism
