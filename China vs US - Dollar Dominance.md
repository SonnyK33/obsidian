 China wants to displace the dollar for Asian trade
	- US has privilege of [[seigniorage]] - ability to buy real assets w fiat and China wants the same 
- China hasn’t opened capital markets bc doesn’t want capital to flee - would like best of both worlds - controls on domestic capital and convertible current account 
	- Belt and road is part of internationalizing the yuan as are central bank swap lines w other Asian countries 
- In 2016 after Shanghai’s g20 abandoned growth at all cost  in favour of stability
- This came to an end at start of Ukraine war bc yen was in free fall and dollar was raging 
	- This put pressure on won and yuan.
	- China was forced to become more restrictive and take liquidity out of the system 
	- The US didn’t protest against Japan though they did when the Vietnamese song devalued earlier 
	- Whole policy may have been engineered by US to prop up dollar and force China to defend its currency 

- Moving towards Breton woods 1 where trade flows only went to Allies -
- Friend shoring - as outlined by yellen, blinken, and freeland

**Gold**
- China may be acquiring large amounts of gold which it could offer to holders of CGBs who wanted to redeem them for hard currency
	- a remedy against possible confiscaiton of USD and EUR by the Fed/ECB
- Gavekal (12.19.21) estimating they have 12k tons of gold (vs the official 2k)
- wants to get to 20% of total M1; at the above rate, they're half way there
- China wants regional central banks to accept CGB's as a store of value - the gold reserves allow them to do that
	- currently the worry that all foreign USD and EUR reserves could be confiscated is hanging over CGB's
- fits with broader theme of countries paying for energy imports in their own currrency (India and China from Russia for oil and gas respectively)
