- a history that captures Burns/Volcker

Russia/Ukraine is entering stasis and China conflict will reach detente. Flashpoint for next year is Iran/Middle East. Agrees with Rogoff that Powell will likely pivot. Ferguson analyzes these issues as a historian and from a political point of view. Zervos, who has been very wrong on inflation, tries to analyze as an economist. Along with other market participants, those attempting to think rationally are arguing that Powell will stay the course per his mandate. Those argue that other issues matter as much as economics are saying he will pivot. I'm persuaded by the latter group if only because the last mile of disinflation is likely to be very difficult politically. No one wants to be Arthur Burns, but there's a reason why Burns did what he did. 


Ferguson:
**Powell/economy**
- Powell won’t manufacture a recession and will pivot
- Likens period to 1970s (structural inflation, oil shock, divided domestic politics)
- Ferguson thinks many more crises lurking w private credit, commercial real estate etc 

**UK**
- no chance Sunak gets re-elected
- A labour majority is coming

**Russia/Ukraine**
- The longer the war goes on, the more radical Ukrainians are becoming. They’re getting more maximalist in their demands which doesn’t bode well for a cease fire.
- However, neither country can handle casualties of this magnitude, and so some kind of stasis is coming
	- Ukraine economy down by a third versus 3% for Russia
- Most wars that last more than 6m, go much further than a year
- The US was about to send planes to Ukraine and then Russia brought up nuclear weapons
- Threatening nuclear weapons has much more psychological value

**China/Taiwan -**
- Biden isn’t reckless enough to risk a Cuban missile crisis and so will offer some kind of detente which China will happily accept
- The fact that the small scale protests didn’t result in a reversal of the reopening (even as Xi was just reappointed president) means it’s likely to continue.
- Could have 1mm premature deaths in China reopening
- What you saw in Taiwan is no one cares about deaths of old ppl as everyone relieved to get out of zero Covid
- Thinks China could rip next year

**MIddle East**
- could be flashpoint in 2022 - Iran may want to develop nuclear weapons and Netanyahu coming to power



Zervos:
- Powell is too afraid to be likened to Arthur Burns from the 70s and will stick to raising rates
- Fed much better equipped than Europeans and even they handled Italian and Uk crises
