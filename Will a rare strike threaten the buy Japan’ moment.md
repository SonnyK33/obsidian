[[Labour Actions]]
Strikes have been rare in Japan even as workers have been suppressed. Real wages haven’t grown, overtime is frequently ignored, workers are overworked, and layoffs have been rampant (check). Why are labour disputes rare? Is it the result of policy or culture? Is think the former since strikes were common in the 1970s when oil shocks resulted in inflation. 

Will a rare strike threaten the ‘buy Japan’ moment?  
  
But it stands out for its rarity. At Japan’s peak bolshiness in 1974, when the country was gripped by an oil price-driven cost of living crisis, there were 5,197 strikes that lasted more than half a day. By 1993 there were 251. In 2022 there were 33. That decline, in all its starkness, demands its own analysis. For many workers in Japan, the past three decades have provided what might, in other eras or in other countries, have seemed ample ammunition for labour disputes. A bruising assault of restructurings, lay-offs, systemically enforced overwork, unpaid overtime and long stagnant wages might appear powerful propellants of industrial action. But they have largely failed to trigger the sort of collective anger or panic that would cancel trains or halt a production lines.
