**Repo Facilities**

1) Repo and reverse repo facilities
[[Reverse Repo Facility]]
The fed controls the repo with the reverse repo facility (allows money market funds to park cash and earn a certain rate - effectively a floor on the repo rate) and the repo facility which lends repo to dealers at a certain rate (effectively a ceiling on the rate). Because treasuries can be repo’d for effectively free and converted to bank deposits, they’re essentially fungible with deposits and cash. 

Currently in the EU, there is excess liquidity due to QE and a lack of collateral (treasury securities). This has caused money market rates to fall below the ECB's set deposit rate. If they enacted a reverse repo system like the one Fed has, it would put a floor on rates as banks could use their excess reserves to earn a rate set by the ECB. Because of the excess liquidity (reserves) in the system, there's limited demand to borrow from money markets - pushing those rates below the ECB deposit rates/

2) Repo rates
There are various repo rates between the Fed's target range. The reverse repo rate serves as a floor (Fed will borrow at this level) and the standing repo facility is a ceiling (Fed will lend at the level).

Fed lower bound < SOFR < RRP < effective fed funds < interest on reserve balances < SRF / upper bound

The SRF (the facility in which the Fed commits to lend at a certain level) is rarely used and was only instituted due to the stress in the repo market in Sept/19 and march/20. 

The FIMA (Foreign and International Monetary Authority) repo facility allows international institutions to exchange UST for dollars and earn rate at the top of the band. This allows foreign institutions to get access to USD without selling treasuries. As the rate is set high, it would only be used in extraordinary circumstances.
