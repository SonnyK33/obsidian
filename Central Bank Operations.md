[[Reverse Repo Facility]]


**Fed Policy Rates**
Within the the Feds' target range, there are various rates applying to different types of borrowers and lenders. The Fed sets a 25 bp range for the EFFR (effective fed funds' rate) which is the rate at which banks can borrow/lend to each other overnight. 

Fed lower bound < SOFR < RRP < effective fed funds rate< interest on reserve balances < SRF / upper bound

The Fed manipulates RRP, IORB, and the SRF to keep the EFFR within the band. If the EFFR trades below the range, it needs to remove reserves from the system. It does this by attracting inflows into the RRP. A high enough RRP rate attracts funds from MMF's who in turn attract flows from customers. If EFFR trades above the range, it needs to add reserves to the system by lending them to banks or other institutionsn through the SRF (this has only occurred during times of stress -  Sept/19 and march/20. The Discount window is set at this level. 

The Fed's lower bound is effectively set by the RRP (see below). The Fed commits to borrow at this level and so it serves as an implicit floor. MMF's make up 90% of the usage of the RRP facility. The RRP rate is set at at 5 bps discount to EFFR (I think?) and is where you lend if you can't earn the IORB rate (for MMFs, GSEs). RRP rates tend to be inversely proportional to money market rates. Higher rates (paid by MMFs to customers), lowers the spread earned (RRP rate - MM rate) and so lowers the usage of the RRP facility. 




1) Repo and reverse repo facilities
[[Reverse Repo Facility]]
The fed controls the repo with the reverse repo facility (allows money market funds to park cash and earn a certain rate - effectively a floor on the repo rate) and the repo facility which lends repo to dealers at a certain rate (effectively a ceiling on the rate). Because treasuries can be repo’d for effectively free and converted to bank deposits, they’re essentially fungible with deposits and cash. 

Currently in the EU, there is excess liquidity due to QE and a lack of collateral (treasury securities). This has caused money market rates to fall below the ECB's set deposit rate. If they enacted a reverse repo system like the one Fed has, it would put a floor on rates as banks could use their excess reserves to earn a rate set by the ECB. Because of the excess liquidity (reserves) in the system, there's limited demand to borrow from money markets - pushing those rates below the ECB deposit rates/

2) Other Repo Facilities

The FIMA (Foreign and International Monetary Authority) repo facility allows international institutions to exchange UST for dollars and earn rate at the top of the band. This allows foreign institutions to get access to USD without selling treasuries. As the rate is set high, it would only be used in extraordinary circumstances. 


3) IORB
This is the main tool used by the Fed to maintain rates in its range. It's the rate the Fed pays bank for depositing reserves. Post-GFC, there aren't any reserve requirements, and so all reserves are considered excess. GSE can't earn IORB and so they lend to banks at EFFR. 
If/when reserves are sufficiently depleted through QT, IORB could trade below FF and SOFR (as the Fed won't have to pay a high rate to get banks to hold reserves)

4) EFFR is the primary target for the Fed. It serves as the borrowing rate for banks and GSEs. Today 90% of all EFFR actvitiy is by GSEs lending to foreign banks (who in turn lend at IORB and earn the spread) . Most of the borrowing is from foreign banks who don't have a depositor base and who can also lend to the Fed at IORB rates. Domestic banks have stricter Basel III regulations that push them to borrow from depositors rather than at EFFR. Domestic banks will typically only borrow at EFFR if they have liquidity needs (GS primer says  this happens when it's above IOR - don't understand this)

5) OBFR - overnight bank funding rate. This is a blend of FF and some eurodollar transactions. MMFs and foreign central banks lend at this rate. 

6) SOFR is a secured rate which is the benchmark used for interbank/dealer repo borrowing. As its secured, it's below the RRP ON level. It's the most likely replacement for LIBOR.
