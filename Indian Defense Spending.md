Following recent clashes with China in Ladakh and Tibet, the Indian government decided they needed to upgrade their military. It became clear that they haven’t kept pace with China in military spending and were not prepared for a conflict. India now regards China as its number one adversary (over Pakistan?). They've also realized how reliant on Russia they are for weapons, as Western pressure to sanction Russi has intensified. They want to upgrade their military but also create an indigenous industry. These two aims are at odds with one another in the short-term as its cheaper to import Russian weapons and easier to rely on legacy systems. The domestic industry has always been reliant on the public sector but is now trying to involve private conglomerates.  

Over two-thirds of military spending goes to personnel, with the rest going to investment. Modi is trying to change this, but it's hard politically. Poverty reduction has been a key part of the BJP's platform and so redirecting spending to defense can be difficult. They've been willing to use surgical strikes against Pakistan, but they know China is a much tougher competitor. Modi is trying to avoid a conflict with China which could highlight the gap between the two militaries. China is gearing up for a conflict with the US and so is much more motivated to develop its military than India. 

Aside with the growing fear around China's rise, this is another example of rising powers wanting to diversify alliances. As India wants to lower its reliance on Russia and not just import US weapons, Japan is also diversifying away from the US by using UK and Italian companies for its new fighter jet program.
