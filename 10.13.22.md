CPI data was a beat, rates are up, and, inexplicably, stocks are up almost 3% today. Stocks immediately sold off on the news and then came all the way back. There was a positive Russia headline, but it seems like stocks rose because many investors were short, and there was a large amount of 1-day calls purchased yesterday. The puts I purchased yesterdy are obviously down, but OXY was up 4% today. Brian said today's strange price action reminded him of 2008, and he posted a rundown of all of the dates when SPX fell more than 1% and then finished up more than 1%. Almost all of the dates were in 2008. The price action and volatility does not look good for markets. Tomorrow will be very telling, another up day could mean this continues through next week.
