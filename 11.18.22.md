Stocks are  up 1% which seems odd as rates are selling off. Oil is down 2% which could explain part of it. It's also Friday and next week is Thanksgiving. Market seems to be getting positive on China reopening even though that's likely to lead to higher oil prices and inflation, making the Fed more hawkish and delays a pivot.

Option expiry - Today is option expiry, and there's 60k open interest of 4000 strike S&P puts. Yesterday these puts were approx 100 delta (because they were ITM and we're 1 day from expiry). Because of the overnight rally these options are ATM and they're 50 delta. Dealers were likely short these puts and short S&P to hedge. Because the delta moved so much (because gamma is so high 1 day from expiry), dealers didn't need to short as much stock and need to buy some back. These creates buying pressure on the underlying.

12pm
Stocks are now down - so it does seem like the option expiry had a lot to do with it. There's also news about a Powell speech on 11/30 which probably caused the market to dip. Rates are still up. Oil is down 2.5% now. 

4pm 
Stocks ened +0.5%. Expect market to digest upcoming Powell speech over the weekend.
