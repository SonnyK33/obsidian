**Realized vol vs Implied vol**
Delta hedging a short option is guaranteed to make profits When realized volatility is below implied. However, infrequent big moves can make it hard to get filled and blow up the hedge. Itâ€™s often better to hedge an option with another option to truncate the blow up risk. Having a trade with bounded downside is easier to maintain and often easier to extract alpha from.
