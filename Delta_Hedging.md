**Realized vol vs Implied vol**
Delta hedging a short option is guaranteed to make profits When realized volatility is below implied. However, infrequent big moves can make it hard to get filled and blow up the hedge. It’s often better to hedge an option with another option to truncate the blow up risk. Having a trade with bounded downside is easier to maintain and often easier to extract alpha from.

**Pinning**
If you’re hedging a short gamma position (eg short puts which dealers tend to be), you’ll do it in a way that exacerbates the underlying move. That’s because when the underlying moves, your losses are non-linear. 

When you’re hedging positive gamma position (long calls which dealers also tend to be) you’ll do it in a way that dampens the move - since you’re gaining non-linearly from the move. 

Can look at skew to get an idea of dealers most likely long gamma (likely w/ calls) or short (w/ puts). Can expect more vol close to expiry if dealers are short gamma.

Dealers tend to be long gamma but can change to short gamma is there’s a big downturn.
