France imports 99pct of uranium from Niger which just had a coup. The leaders of the revolt had strong ties to the U.S. was this a plot to stop France from achieving energy independence like the bombing of the Nord stream? The US wants to keep countries dependent on its LNG and wants to keep them away from renewables since China dominates that market. 

As calls for ECOWAS to intervene militarily grow, there's risk of spillover, especially in Nigeria.
