SK was bleak post-Korean war. Rhee, the first president was western backed and corrupt. He had an import substitution model which was to develop domestic industry which wasnâ€™t working. Park followed Rhee and shifted to exports; he was influenced by his time in Japan. He favored anyone who could export with tax breaks, made it easy for them to import parts etc. There was a very public facing push to exports, and the government allied with conglomerates. This benefited labor intensive manufacturing - such as textiles and even wigs.  

Nixon's Guam doctrine at end of the 1960s in conjunction with the Vietnam war was withdrawing troops from Asia(?) which caught the Park regime off guard. They were behind NK in heavy industry and arms manufacturing and was dependent on US troop presence. The new policy called HCI and was influenced by Japanese industrialization. It eventually got international funding which was channeled through the domestic banking sector whose goal was to push credit into strategic sectors. Companies could borrow at below market rates. The policy worked as there were more exports from these sectors and they gained a comparative advantage.
