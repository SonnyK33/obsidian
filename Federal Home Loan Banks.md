"BAML - US Rates Tech-in: Federal Home Loan Banks"

There are 4 main GSEs:
1) FNMA and FMAC - support the mortgage markets
2) FHLBs - lend to local banks in their district ("lender of second last resort")
3) Federal Farm Credit Bank (FFCB) - agriculture related lending, similar to FHLBs

All FHLB lending is secured, and it takes no interest rate risk (swaps to floating rates). Borrowers must have a positive CET1 capital position (believe this is net of intangible assets as well). Most lending is less than 1 year. It has priority over the FDIC in a bankruptcy. FHLB lending has grown as QT has reduced liquidity for banks. It accelerated during the recent bank runs. Lending is similar to the Fed's discount window. FHLB only accepts mortgage related collateral, including mortgages and MBS. FHLBs in turn lend from the money markets, funded by MMFs.
