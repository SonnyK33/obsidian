China has become a major lender to the developing world. While its debt stock is often lower than multilaterals', its debt service often exceeds the others as its rate is higher. It's not charging the concessional (1-2%) rates charged by multilaterals but 5-6% which are close to the US Treasury bilateral bailout loans or the eurozone loans extended to peripheral Europe in 2010-12.

The Chinese lending binge resembles what US commercial banks did in the 1970s. At that time, the banks were flush with USD deposits from oil exporters. They were encouraged to recycle those surpluses into Latin America where US corporates had expanded. Since the financial crisis, China has similarly recycled its capital surpluses into the devloping world through its belt and road initiative. The previous crisis was solved by the Brady Bonds which were long-term bonds whose principal was guaranteed by US treasuries. It's unlikely that China agrees to something similar today. Like the commercial banks in the 1970s, China has continuously extended loans to avoid write-downs. 

For now, China has withdrawn its demand that the multilaterals take haircuts as well. It's an exaggeration that China has been a roadblock to all negotiations. They granted 2/3 of debt relief as part of the DSSI (debt service initiaive launched during covid) though they only had 1/3 of the claims. They also agreed to terms in Sri Lanka. But it will likely alter how it lends to developing countries. Its issuance of loans to Africa has been in decline since 2022.
