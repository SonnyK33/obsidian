Is Vincent de Valmont the absurd man that Camus describes? Camus talks at length about Don Juan and how seducing many women and not caring about the consequences is embracing the absurdity of life. Tourvel describes him as a libertine with all of its negative connotations. I think he’s different from what Camus describes because he seems to enjoy toying with women rather than looking for a diversity of experiences.

  

Cecile is extremely naive and has never encountered anyone who wished her harm. A good reason to make sure your kids are exposed to good and bad experiences when they are young. The Way she talks about men and love reminds me of that Gabriel Lorca play. That play was thought to be an allegory for the conservatism of the Catholic Church in fascist Spain. Cecile just came from a convent and shows the same kinda of repressed feelings as X.

  

Merteuil talks about how the letter gives away your true feelings, and how it’s easier to deceive with live speech because of the raw emotions. The time it takes to write and send a letter also allows the recipient to gather their feelings and prepare a response. Modern technology obviously changes a lot of this.

  

Madame Volanges talks about the importance of others’ opinions and how you have no right to complain if you lose the public trust. Hell is other people. 

  

Vincent wonders where Tourvel is hiding the letters as there are no fires that time of the year. He concludes they must be in her pockets and wishes he had the skills of a pickpocket. He says that should be a required skill of a man of intrigue. But that parents don’t think of these things.

  

Presidente is hyper rational and doesn’t believe that potential love should override reason.

Surprising how much everyone trusts the marquis

While vicomte is a libertine who seeks as many experiences as possible, Marteil is cold and calculating. She grew up without friends or the convent so learned everything through experience. She learned sex must be enjoyable since it was forbidden by the church. She’s rich and aristocratic and hence not shackled by customs or laws but she’s still rebelling against the conservative culture of the ancien regime. 

  

Her main goal is to maintain the upper hand in everything. She’s willing to make the wrong decision rather than let her true motivations be known. She has none of Vicomtes sensitivity and was willing to destroy Prevan. While she comes from the conservative nobility, she’s also clearly a feminist and is fighting against male dominated society. I wonder which character elicited more anger from the commoners.

Vincent is least happy when he’s analyzing the actions of Tourvel and searching for meaning. He’s happiest when he ignore all meaning and pursued quantity.

Marteil is honest when she tells Cecile that passion is overrated and she should instead focus on the logical. Although she’s been deceitful that’s an accurate depiction of she operates.

Vincent isn’t an absurd man. He pursues women just to ruin them, not for the experience. He sees a lot of meaning in his actions. It’s remarkable how similar social relations were back then. Vincent talks about women who pursue men for the prestige for example. Madame rosemomt warns that men pursue actions for their reward, whereas women aim to serve. For women, service itself was the goal. Complains made by one gender about the other were the exact same back then. 

  

Valmont and marquis are jealous of what Cecile and Delaney have. Valmont is in love with madame tourmont and marquis is too afraid of being the victim. They hide these feelings in their games.

Marquis didn’t remarry bc she wanted to be able to deceive for fun not out of necessity. They eventually go to war with each other as they get jealous of each others lovers. Despite them both being libertines of sorts.

The most striking thing to me is how modern the story seems. The very last letter from Celine’s mother is a warning to parents to watch their kids. Sons and daughters. 

  

It’s also very much a morality story. At the end, marquis gets small pox, is disfigured, and loses the court case.
