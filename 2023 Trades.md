- Where are the asymmetric risks for 2023?
	- conflict over Taiwan (getting to be mainstream)
		- Chinese equities already cheap
		- who gets sanctioned by US besides China/Russia
	- hard landing vs short landing 
		- being long skew looks like good risk/return 
		- long unsecured/2nd lien debt vs short 1st lien/secured - not 1:1, want to be "vega-neutral"
	- Eurozone crisis
		- high fiscal deficits + QT + higher rates
		- could reserves fall below acceptable level?
	- structurally sticky inflation
		- getting close to mainstream
		- not priced in 1yr gold skew (which has flattened since 2021)

**Financing Costs/Credit**
Calculate your breakeven on a bond. That is, what spread widening would offset net carry (yield less financing cost). How does that widening compare to Oct/Nov wides?

By that metric, CCC's look okay.
Net carry = YTW (13.3%) - repo (4.5%) = ~9%
OAD is 3.3 years, so would need a 300 bps widening to lose 9 pts.
300 bps widening = 1240 bps vs 2022 wides of 1170

Compare that to HYG.
Net carry = 8% - 4.5% = 3.5%
Duratio is 4.3 years, so need 75 bps of widening to lose 3 pts. 
75 bps widening = 500 spread vs October wides of 520

HYG is 50% BB, 40% single-B

**2023 Bets**
1) Will the Fed cut rates in 2023?
2) Will the ECB continue tightening?
3) Will Italian government stick to fiscal plan?
4) Will the BoJ abandon YCC?
5) Will Egypt comply with the IMF program?
6) Will Argentenians re-elect current government?
