12.13.22
Term structure has become very steep, and it may make sense to short long-term vol against short-term. Short 1y put-spreads?
Dec 2023 - Jan 2023 IV for 25D puts is 5 pts
Dec 2022 - Jan 2022 in Dec 2021 was about 0 pts 

The 2021 reading in hindsight was a great time to be long vol

Short 12/15/23 25D put (350 strike at 27% IV) @ $16.20
Long 12/15/23 10D put (290 strike at 32% IV) @ $7.39

This is also short skew (in line with selling odds of soft recession and long odds of major recession outlined by [[Macro Compass - 12.11.22]]
