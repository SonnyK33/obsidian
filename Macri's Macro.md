Macri attempted to run a restrictive monetary policy while keeping fiscal flexible. This was done as he was perceivedÂ as being right-win, and so he wanted to earn political capital with the people. Bringing down inflation became difficult as so much of the budget was indexed. As inflation came down, the real pension expense increased due to the backward indexation system (how does this work?)

  

The central bank had to monetize a portion of the deficit, as they could borrow at this time. The central bank was also told not to sterilize (i.e. issue treasuries) as their balance sheet was already stretched.

  

They lifted capital controls slowly as there were pent up dividend and import payments, and they were afraid of a large outflow. Net reserves were also negative (likely due to dollar denominated sovereign debt).

**Inflation Targeting**
Central bank assessed the various ways to target inflation. In addition to aligned fiscal and monetary policies, there are various ways to target inflation:
1) use exchange rate as anchor
2) income policies (price caps)
3) target money supply
4) most orthodox - target with floating exchange rates (and use interest rates)

The benefits of using the exchange rate as an anchor is it often leads to an initial boom and helps to quickly coordinate expectations. The boom may help with buy-in, and the fixed rate shows a commitment to a target. However, it requires sufficient reserves and removes the flexibility that comes with having FX as a shock absorber. Macri chose the orthodox approach because he wanted to have FX as an absorber, and was influenced by the the crisis in 1998-01 (when there were fixed rates). He was also afraid of the international push back if he favored income policies.
