Macri attempted to run a restrictive monetary policy while keeping fiscal flexible. This was done as he was perceivedÂ as being right-win, and so he wanted to earn political capital with the people. Bringing down inflation became difficult as so much of the budget was indexed. As inflation came down, the real pension expense increased due to the backward indexation system (how does this work?)

  

The central bank had to monetize a portion of the deficit, as they could borrow at this time. The central bank was also told not to sterilize (i.e. issue treasuries) as their balance sheet was already stretched.

  

They lifted capital controls slowly as there were pent up dividend and import payments, and they were afraid of a large outflow. Net reserves were also negative (likely due to dollar denominated sovereign debt).

**Inflation Targeting**
Central bank assessed the various ways to target inflation. In addition to aligned fiscal and monetary policies, there are various ways to target inflation:
1) use exchange rate as anchor
2) income policies (price caps)
3) target money supply
4) most orthodox - target with floating exchange rates (and use interest rates)

The benefits of using the exchange rate as an anchor is it often leads to an initial boom and helps to quickly coordinate expectations. The boom may help with buy-in, and the fixed rate shows a commitment to a target. However, it requires sufficient reserves and removes the flexibility that comes with having FX as a shock absorber. Macri chose the orthodox approach because he wanted to have FX as an absorber, and was influenced by the the crisis in 1998-01 (when there were fixed rates). He was also afraid of the international push back if he favored income policies.

inflation targeting requires:
1) absence of other nominal anchors
2) commitment to price stability
3) absence of fiscal dominance
4) c bank autonomy
5) policy transparency

Argued that to reduce pass through, should say they didnt care about the exchange rate and not have that as a separate target. There were disagreements with the treasury around rates. The central bank was forced to monetize some deficits, and only some of these were sterilized. 

**Backward Indexation**
As inflation stats weren't reliable, pensions were indexed to tax receipts and wages which effectively tied them to nominal GDP. Because they're indexed backwards, their real value is reduced when inflation accelerates in context of disinflation (?). Is that a typo?
In 2017, budget improved 1.1%  (in constant inflation terms) but deficit went from 4.2% to 3.8%: disinflation had increased the real value of pensions which undid the fiscal cuts. This caused the treasury to want to slow the disinflation process. Taxes were also cut, so the overall fiscal picture got worse. The government was unable to change the indexation process due to union pressure. The government tried to fiscally consolidate, but disinflation actually made that harder, which changed the preferences of the treasury.  Backward indexation made up half of the government's expenditures. 

The opposite happened in 2018 when inflation accelerated. It caused a reduction in the real value of pension and social programs and reduced the primary deficit. The lack of fiscal progress, plus a reduction in the private sector's wages, hurt the current account. By end of 2017 there were concerns with external balances. 

**Capital Flows**
The large fiscal deficit required external capital flows (since savings rate were too low). The central bank accumulated reserves by sterilizing these flows, which stopped the currency from appreciating. 

**Crisis**
The disinflation had worsened the fiscal balance because of backward indexation. In order to reduce rollover risk, they lengthened the duration of debt which led to higher long-term rates. This made local financing more expensive. By the end of the year, Treasury wanted slower disinflation and the Ministry of Finance wanted lower local rates. The country was forced to increase its inflation target. Only 3 countries have done this - Brazil (03) , Indonesia (05), and Turkey (08). In the two former cases, long-term targets were kept and there was no change in monetary policy. Turkey similarly raised the target in the middle of a successful disinflation. This had a lasting impact on credibility. The central bank cut rates in December first by 75 bps and then again two weeks later. The first had a minimal market impact as people were relieved it wasn't larger. The second cut was seen as a shift and the Peso depreciated. 

After they cut rates, they felt the need to intervene in the FX markets as the exchange rate had a larger impact on inflation (I think due to more imports on back of lower rates). This further confused the market. In order to lower rates, the central bank cut rates on longer Lebacs and said they wouldn't issue new instruments longer than 5 months. This increased rollover risk. As credibility fell, doubts began to emerge about its ability to rollover debt, most of which was external and dollar denominated. This made the fiscal balance vulnerable to large devaluations. 

The government passed a tax on instruments including lebacs by non-residents. This caused an exit from local instruments, forcing the central bank to sell reserves and buy Lebacs. The bank wanted to use FX as an anchor, but also wanted to allow a depreciation given the worsening market. Fed tightening and a drought also made things worse. The lack of clarity on the FX regime didn't help, and they decided to seek help from the IMF, which didn't calm the market.  Rollover risk for Lebacs worsened and the central bank decided to offer new Peso debt with a guaranteed exchange rate (40% above spot levels). The market anticipated that the IMF would prevent the central bank from selling reserves to buy Lebacs and would prefer more depreciation. This caused pressure on FX in anticipation of a deal. 

The new head of the central bank tried to reduce Lebacs by issuing new debt or even using FX reserves. This didn't make sense as you can't sterilize the money supply with issuance. After a large maturity occurred and only a small amount of reserves were sold, the monetary base jumped 16%, causing a 30% exchange rate shock. The depreciation eventually helped by reducing the value of central bank liabilities. This came at the cost of reducing credibility though, and increasing yields.
