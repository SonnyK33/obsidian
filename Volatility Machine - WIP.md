All cap structures are volatility machines. They transform market volatility into asset return volatility. The type of capital structure determines whether it dampens or exacerbates vol. this same logic can be applied to sovereign capital structures. Some assets increase in value when vol increases and some decrease. Can apply Merton corporate finance to sovereign analysis

Cap structure traps are when incomes are likely to go down at the same time debt service is likely to rise. Seeing this now with oil importers.

  

Mexico’s financial crisis in 94 started with devaluing its currency. It abandoned the crawling peg as investor sentiment had changed and was pulling dollars out of the country. It was running out of reserves and so had to devalue. (Similar to Nigeria today?). Money flowed into Mexico after it went through the Brady restructuring and overhauled its economic policies including establishing the drawling peg.

After the passage of nafta, there was a lot of excitement towards Mexico. Up until late that year, the central bank has to intervene to prevent appreciation beyond the peg and was accumulating reserves. The free trade agreement caused money to flow into Mexico. What changed we’re capital inflows especially from the US into Mexico. Japanese slows into the US slowed which lowered appetite for risk assets. The Fed also began hiking. While capital flows slowed, the current account didn’t. Reserves started to fall. They could have slowed exports by raising rates (they had already gone from 9 to 20pct), but it was hard to go further given the fiscal deficit. It was getting hard to pay interest locally. It was also an election year.

They instead engaged in actions which showed they wouldn’t devalue by making it costly to devalue. They issued dollar linked peso treasuries and allowed banks to take in dollar deposits. When they were eventually forced to devalue these measures became very expensive.

  

Exactly what’s happening now. Slowing capital flows and current account deficits.

The tesobonos- dollar linked peso bonds made things worse. Investors now faced convertibility risk as the government didn’t have sufficient dollars to pay investors and was reluctant to print enough pesos to make investors whole. This caused investors to insist on dollars for repayment and further depreciated the currency. This hurt corporates who borrowed in dollars as well as local currency as local rates skyrocketed. Ordinary people and businesses went bankrupt. It eventually was bailed out by the US and the IMF. Have any countries recently issued bonds like these? Where could there be a currency crisis? Nigeria, Egypt? Investors facing redemptions pull out of other EMs as well.

Mexican crisis, the subsequent Asian financial crisis (starting in Thailand), and the Russian default all started with currency crises. Devaluations for EMs are generally contractionary. There are exceptions though. The devaluation in Brazil in the 1980s and even an earlier one in Thailand didn’t lead to crisis. The ones that did had unstable capital structures. He compares sovereigns to corporates with economic policies the analogue to assets. He focuses instead on the right side, the liability side. A capital structure may exacerbate or suppress external volatility depending on how it indexes payments.  I believe he’s saying that it you’re  likely to have a current account deficit when you have capital outflows, that’s the wrong capital structure.

EMs lack a sizable base of long term value investors to smooth out volatility like you have JJ developed markets. This exacerbates short term fluctuations.

Not sure if that’s still true

There are two models explaining capital flows from rich to poor countries. The first and most prevalent one is the investment model which focuses on local market conditions. It argues that money will flow into developing countries that are enacting the right pro growth policies. The author argues that the liquidity model, which says flows are a function of developed country policies, is the correct one. It argues that those pro growth policies are a function of the capital flows and not the other way around.

  

Uses kindleberger and minskys model of stability.

Stability creates instability. During times of calm, people get more risk tolerant and set the stage for the next crisis. Changes in the regulatory environment - for example creating new banks or Hamilton consolidating legacy debt can allow for more credit creation. In turn, this will incite new risky behavior.

Increases in money-like securities (eg things that can be used for collateral or monetizes) also increases the money supply and leads to credit creation. For example, Frances reparation payments to Prussia were financed bonds. This helped to monetize the state of France and led to new securities which could be margined. Similarly, more dollars circulating in an EM (where many ppl may accept dollars), increases money supply. Hamilton’s consolidation of the debt led to new money like securities which could be margined. 

  

The liquidity cycle -

Money supply is expanded in a DM

Leads to more liquidity which leads to more marginable securities 

Asset prices further rise and returns lower 

Eventually leads to seeking higher yields internationally 

Capital flows into EMs which appreciate local currencies, equity markets, and banking sectors 

Leads to more credit growth and calls for more pro-growth policies

Capital inflows May coincide with higher commodity prices and hence more exports from the EM

However, capital inflows necessitate a current account deficit and so imports grow even faster

Higher FX, trade deficit, more credit creation

Attracts more capital 

Eventually the inflows reverse

Just when the market is at peak vulnerability

There were 2 liquidity cycles in the 20th century that affected EMs. The first was in the 1920s when the US ram surpluses and attracted good inflows which led to international lending. The second was after the Yom Kippur war when oil prices rose causing petrodollars to flow into Eurodollar accounts which found their way to emerging markets. Kindleburger says it actually begun when burns lowered rates to help Nixon win. Lately there was 2006-7, and 2020-21.

  

There’s two kinds of shocks that can stop the cycle. Exogenous shocks which cause a flight to quality (eg the Mexican crisis in 94 or Covid recently). And second, large scale global deleveraging which leads to a contraction of global liquidity. This makes it hard to refinance debt in EMs and leads to defaults.

  

Small moves in money centers have disproportionate impacts on developing countries. This book was written before china’s rise, and would include liquidity coming there if written today.

  

Most developing countries are already vulnerable to commodity shocks. And the resource curse includes overvalued exchange rates and underdeveloped export industries which makes it more vulnerable to price shocks. Liquidity and commodity prices are correlated and so a shock in liquidity causes the the other.

  

Under the liquidity model, local policies follow capital flows not the other way around. Capital flows allow the government to move away from

SOEs and crony capitalism by allowing opportunities to elites. It allows the monetary base to expand while pushing up the currency. They allow the country to invest in long term projects like infrastructure and do incentivize progrowth policies. So the causation moves in the other direction.

  

Analysts often claim causation goes from policies to flows. This leads to a free market ideology that encourages free trade and similar reforms. It leads to claims that the East Asian tigers were successful due to free market reforms. However many tried these policies in the past and failed (eg Colombia and Chile in the 19th century were more open than the US). The successful EM stories - Uk and France in the 17th century and US and Germany in the 19th century did not practice free market ideology (same for China in the 20th century). People claim Mexico attracted capital due to reforms in the 1980s. But Pinochet did the same much earlier, yet flows into all of LatAm happened at the same time - when liquidity was plentiful in the US.

  

Under this model local policies don’t really matter. It’s very difficult for EMs to prevent capital outflows as they’re decided by others. All the countries can do is dampen volatility by changing how they’re funded. Much like a corporate, their capital structure determines how it responds to external volatility.

Further evidence of the liquidity theory is that investment and flows into developing countries comes and goes in waves. If they were driven by local conditions you’d expect them to be more randomly distributed. That is, different countries are going through different reforms at different times. And so if that’s what driving in flows, they shouldn’t be moving in waves.

First international lending boom was in the 1820s following Englands defeat of France in the napoleonic wars. The French indemnity payment, bullion reserves, consolidation of British debt and  excess savings (from not having to fight a war) led to excess liquidity.

Some of this was used to seek investment opportunities abroad and led to more lending to Latin America l.

The second boom in the 1830s was caused by British capital flows into the US. Changes in British regulations led to many more

Banks and hence credit. The large profits earned by the British east company were deposited at the Bank of England and were guaranteed high rates.

The BOE hence looked for ways to earn Ana adequate return to pay for the deposits.

  

The US was going through its own boom. The bank of the US was dismantled leaving space for many competing state banks all expanding credit. The US also started selling private land and were converted into deposits which led to more credit expansion. All of this led to a larger money supply masked as growth.

This attracted the British who financed the large U.S. trade deficit.

The third boom in the 1860s was caused the same way. New financial innovations - the aforementioned Franco Prussian reparation payments,

Deposit banks in France, and joint stock companies in Germany all created new money. Wars have been a major financial innovator in the US. There was a frenzy in the US over railway and other stocks led by people like jay gould

In the 1970s Arthur burns lowered rates to help Nixon win. At the same time, the German central bank had a tight monetary policy. So dollars flowed out of the US into the Eurodollar market. Many countries esp in the Soviet bloc also wanted to hold dollars outside the U.S. to avoid confiscation. OPEC and the first oil embargo pushed oil from $2 to 40 in a decade leading to large trade surpluses. These two factors led to a new boom in lending to developing countries.

  

Each episode followed the same cycle. Some change in the definition of money leads to a credit expansion. For example, in the late 90s and early 2000s, mortgage backed securities allowed for the monetization of real estate. That leads to a frenzy and the need to chase yield in foreign markets. The inflows lead to improving local markets which encourages more lending.

  

What new forms of money are being created now? Banks can now borrow par against discount bonds and refinance if interest rates decrease.

  

Liquidity contractions

  

The Q

1820s boom came to an end when the Bank of England saw its gold reserves dwindling due to foreign investment and rising imports. It

Wanted to accumulate reserves and so it raised the discount rate. Since many of Latin American loans were questionable already, refinancing quickly dried up. The slowdown domestically also hurt commodity prices. The twin effect was to make it impossible for the Latin American borrowers to repay.

Next bubble was popped by the US requiring all land purchases to be done in silver or gold

This voiding bank promissory notes for land purchases

Crisis in Argentina almost brought down barings bank which sucked up liquidity in London and prevented it from going into other EM projects

There’s a distinction between long term liquidity contractions caused by changes in money centers (which lead to defaults) and short term margin collapses like the Asian financial crisis which are closer to bank runs. The latter are caused by domestic conditions and though may be exacerbated by poor policies the effects tend to be temporary. In general, most financial crises are global in nature and caused by changing international monetary policies not domestic policies.

  

This is esp true of emerging markets as they’re so much smaller.

  

Cap structure

In corp finance, maximize value of enterprise by minimizing risk of distress

Do this by lowering possibility of mismatch between revenues and expenses

  

For a corporate that would mean minimizing financial and operating leverage 

Shouldn’t be burning cash when less is coming in 

  

Companies whose business is hurt by higher rates eg builders shouldn’t have a lot floating rate debt 

  

Author says the least important part of cfos job is relative value - optimizing timing of issuances 

While that’s what sovereign debt issuers focus on 

  

That sounds about right. Their job is obvs a lot harder than a cfos tbh with mainly more political constraints 

Important to understand their job through the prism of constraints

As a corp nears distress, equity investors are less likely to support even profitable investments as a large portion of proceeds are shared by creditors.

Can use the Merton model quantify this. The deltas can be interpreted as the share of the asset value increase accruing to the call (equity) or put (debt). Since creditors are short a put, higher debt value should be interpreted as lower spreads i.e. lower put premium (what you want if you’re short the put). 

Since the call and out deltas have to sum to one, increases in asset value accrue to one or the other (or a combination). Also can see this with the accounting identity.   

  

When a firm is a strong credit, equity (call option) is deeply ITM and the delta is close to 1. Debt (short put) has a delta equal to 1 - call delta, that is, close to zero. Shareholders will favour investments as they capture most of the gain. When the credit is in distress, the opposite is true and they’ll be against investments (AMC is a counter example). 

  

Sovereigns are similar. When they’re in distress, there is limited support to build up productive capacity, as any additional export income Wil go to creditors. Authors argues that sovereigns have higher spreads bc they tend to be more volatile and more likely to face distress. Thus financial distress imposes costs on sovereigns. Investment is curtailed, business aren’t started, and there is limited ability to attract capital. Infrastructure is neglected.

  

Financial ministries should try to lower debt and decrease the net flows. The latter means increasing the correlation between inflows and outflows (ie debt service). However most sov cap structures decrease this correlation. Capital inflows drive up debt issuance but also lead to trade deficits. So a mismatch is actually the most likely scenario when you have an open capital account.

Impact or volatility

Vol increases the time value of the call (equity) but decreases the intrinsic value as it hurts the underlying. This can be thought of as skew - spot vol correlation. If skew is downward sloping, an increase in vol which lowers the underlying may result in a net decrease in value. In the Merton example, this is normally the case - an increase in volatility lowers intrinsic value more than it increases time value. The exception is for highly indebted countries where intrinsic value is very low. In those cases it makes sense for finance ministries to take risks. That’s also where it makes sense to be short credit (long a put). Management/government will be incentivized to take more risk which will increase the put value. It’s an obvious point but you want to be short credit where intrinsic value is zero or close to it because management had no choice but to take the risks. 

  

For creditors it’s simpler. Higher vol increases put intrinsic and time value. Since credits are short the put they lose value. 

  

The same logic applies to sovereigns.

Sovereigns should avoid inverted capital structures - where debt servicing increases just as things get worse (analogous to an airline who pays a rate indexed to oil). FX debt is the most obvious example.

As things get worse, the currency depreciates which raises the cost of foreign debt. Short term is another one. Counterintuitively, you’d be better off borrowing long term even if at much higher rates. It lowers the overall volatility of your net flows. However, for distressed sovereigns, you’re prob better off taking a chance even if Volatility increases as it’s better for the equity value (see last section). 

In some ways, having inverted cap structures almost defines emerging markets - borrowing short term and using FX debt.

EMs tend to use inverted capital structures. When things are going well they double down and borrow in FX. They’re incentivized to use volatile capital structure.

  

Capital structure is a transmission of volatility. It explains why a small policy error can be magnified in some cases. Rather than focusing on specific policies and flow variables (current account, fiscal accounts, cronyism etc) should focus on stock variables - how is the debt structured. The left tends to blame crises on speculators and the right blames the lack of market reforms. The real culprit is the structure of liabilities. Inverted capital structures are a trap because you fall into them by acting rationally. You choose shorter term debt because it’s cheaper. You seek higher returns to compensate for higher risk.

  

The Asian financial crisis actually became a boom for latam. They quickly turned current account deficits into surpluses which led to exports of capital to the U.S. this was recycled into Latin America.

It’s hard for corporates to fall into the same trap as sovereigns bc when they perform poorly that won’t be enough to move the currency the way it for a sovereign. But if they borrow short term the effect is the same.

  

Mexico and Indonesia both fell in the trap due to fx debt. In Mexico a weaker currency caused defaults which caused banks to raise rates which caused even more defaults. In Indonesia, the weaker currency had a similar effect and caused defaults and an even weaker currency. EMs always borrow in an inverted way during good times. They’re incentivized to borrow in FX and short term if rates are high. The traps are self reinforcing and don’t require poor policy or irrational activity, actually the opposite. Banking crises frequently exacerbate crises by causing credit to be rationed and pushing rates higher.

This causes the exchange rate to go through any equilibrium to previously irrational levels until a large player can offset.

Fall into the trap bc:

1) during good times become convinced that policy reforms will continue. An inverted structure makes sense since you only care about 

Upside risk 

  

2) when things start to turn you try to make adjustments - borrow short term for example - which makes it worse

  

3 you want to signal credibility so use an inverted structure

South Korea suddenly crashed during the Asian financial crisis despite a small trade deficit and a strong economy. Occurred because most debt was short term and FX denominated . Explained why it bounced back so quick (with imf help) and was more severe than other crashes in the region . Others had less short term debt.

Dollar or fx  position of banking sector 

Availability of local currency debt markets

Two examples of mismatched capital structure in 2000 -

Brazil - too much short term floating rate local debt

Argentina - too much external debt coupled with a trade deficit and no control over fx (currency board). Many thought that cutting fiscal deficit could be used to generate excess pesos which could be used to buy dollars from private sector and cut external debt. However, the large trade deficit meant that even with a fiscal surplus, there would be a savings deficit (by definition). It would just shift the need to raise dollars from the public to the private sector which would likely find it tougher. Previously the private sector got dollars from the public sector who effectively paid them out with the fiscal deficit. Compare this to Pettis argument around why cutting the US fiscal deficit won’t cut the trade deficit. Also compare this with Egypt today. Cutting the fiscal deficit won’t help - except to the extent that it can cut the trade deficit.

Planners of a sovereign cap structure (debt management office etc) should be pessimistic and not assume spreads will tighten over time. Most debt managers are also responsible for setting policy and hence are biased and assume their policies will improve credit worthiness. Hence they’re attempted to implement correlated capital structures that increase leverage. Just like CFOs who don’t hedge or who borrow short term. As discusses the primary drivers of spreads aren’t internal policies but capital flows and commodity prices. So you want different officials running LME who aren’t biased and won’t assume spreads will come down as a result of their policies. Similarly, corporate spreads are primarily driven by macro factors, and it makes sense to have less operating leverage and hedge. They should have a neutral outlook. 

  

Which sovereigns have truly have a neutral outlook? And which are implicitly assuming spreads will improve? Egypt clearly made this mistake when they went to the IMF.

Using correlated structures should lower debt servicing costs. Borrowing in local currency normally seems more expensive, but that’s partially because many sovereigns have high external debt loads. 

  

Using correlated structures gives the borrower positive asymmetry. In good times, you owe more (eg FX appreciates, so your debt is worth more to dollar investors), and in bad times you owe less. On average this should lower your borrowing cost. The liability should trade slightly above par. The opposite is true for FX debt. In bad times you owe more. In those times, the yield will be much higher. This liability should trade at a discount to par and on average raise the borrowing cost.

EMs should essentially never borrow in foreign currencies. Sovereign defaults are much more damaging to an economy than even widespread corporate defaults as there’s no mechanism for orderly workouts. The US saw lots of defaults in the 19th century among states and corporations to foreign lenders, but the sovereign never borrowed in FX and hence never defaulted. That’s true for Japan (and in modern times, China and India) as well. Not defaulting is one thing that separates EMs that graduate to developed and those that don’t. It causes a protracted period of uncertainty and it takes a while for investment to return. 

  

Long dates fixed rate local debt is the most correlated form of borrowing a sovereign can use and is the closest thing to equity. In good times, the debt increases due to a stronger FX and lower rates. Since assets are local currency denominated though, the state still benefits from the appreciation, it just shares some benefits with the lender. The opposite is true in bad times - FX depreciates, inflation rises, and the debt is inflated away. It acts as a shock absorber. It’s tempting to use FX debt in good times because it’s cheaper, but local debt (if a sufficient curve exists) is the more responsible path.

  

Question - how are some countries able to develop strong local debt markets and others aren’t? Eg india doesn’t rely on FX debt and hasn’t for some time

When the credit is sufficiently impaired, it goes from being short a put to being synthetically long a call

Why?

Debt restructuring typically increases volatility because it includes short term payments, rigid payments ie not equity like, and insufficient haircuts.

At high levels of debt, the PV may actually increase with haircuts as the discount rate goes down materially. This isn’t the case for sovereigns that just have a liquidity problem. Since owning the debt is equivalent to being short a put, you want to decrease the value of the put. You can lower the volatility of the underlying. Owning the debt is also negatively convex, the delta increases as the quality of the debt decreases. Not sure I get that - delta should increase as the underlying loses value.

If you want fixed exchange rates, domestic interest rates have to adjust automatically to capital flows - impossible trinity 

So they’re most in need of a correlated capital structure

Analysts thought all devaluations are bad and didn’t realize the benefits that brazil would realize. And how that tied with fiscal credibility.

Sovereigns focus on minimizing borrowing cost not decreasing volatility. Greenspan pointed this out in testimony and described the insurance like benefits of long term debt.

Owing debt should be thought of as being short a put spread. You’re short a put struck at your level of debt / assets and you’re long a put stuck at the next level of debt (or zero if it’s the senior tranche). That’s because you can’t lose more than you lent even if the asset value continues to decline beyond your tranche. 

  

Deeply discounted debt can also be thought of as long a call option since you’re gains are asymmetrical and you want more volatility.

Your position delta is the sum of the two deltas 

It will be maximized roughly half way between the par value of the debt tranche and zero. As the asset value continues to decline, the long put’s delta starts to matter. Not sure I agree with this. Ie does the long put really matter?

Below par value, the debt delta is greater than the equity delta and hence is more equity like. Also suggests delta isn’t maximized when assets are worth zero but half way between par and zero.

  

A similar analysis for Vega. Which is maximized when at the money. The long put Vega increases as assets get close to zero. So for discounted debt, Vega is positive and you want volatility. The sum of the two Vegas is maximized when the assets are at zero. 

  

A synthetic call is long the underlying plus long put. If asset value is close to zero, the short put has a delta close to one (like owning the underlying) and he has the long put. so the combo resembles a synthetic call.
