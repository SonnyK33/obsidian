by [[HG Wells]]

Describes an alien invasion in 19th century Britain. The aliens are locust-like, slowly dstroying everything they come into contact with. Wells said book was an allegory for [[imperialism]] - particularly the impact of European colonization on Aboriginal Tasmanians. 

The aliens invade Earth because they ran out of natural resources. When they first arrive, the  military waves a white flag and attempts to meet the aliens with peace. The aliens respond by incinerating the soldiers (scene and the novel are likely inspirations for the movie Independence Day).

The aliens eventually are killed by a bacertial infection to which they have no immunity. 

"slain, after all man's devices had failed, by the humblest things that God, in his wisdom, has put upon this earth"

The novel takes place during the Victorian age when Britain was the dominant colonial superpower. Many Britons had a sense that their age of superiority was close to an end - 
 _[fin de siècle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fin_de_si%C3%A8cle "Fin de siècle")_ or 'end of the age', which anticipated an apocalypse occurring at midnight on the last day of 1899.

It plays on Britons' insecurities relating to a more powerful invader (as well as a critique of their own imperialism)

Takeaway - very similar to Americans' fears regarding the world today. The US is the dominant [[superpower]], but the government constantly hypes up foreign threats, and that insecurity drives much foreign policy and spending decisions.
