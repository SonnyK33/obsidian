The US is trying to pull India into its conflict with China. It's increasing defense cooperation and involving India in alliances like the Quad (with Japan, US, and Australia). While India welcomes this cooperation, it's purely for its own advancement. It wants to build up its own defense sector and seeks American technology to help it. But it's also aware of its power disparity with China, and won't risk a hot military conflict with it. If there is a real war in the region, India will want the US to prevail, but it won't aid it militarily unless it sees a threat to itself.
