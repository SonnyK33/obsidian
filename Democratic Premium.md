Turkey vs Egypt notes
**The power of democracy (even illiberal democracy)**
It's interesting to compare Turkey and Egypt given how differently they trade (5Y Egypt is ~1,500/40 pts bps vs 500 for Turkey).

1. Current account deficit is 13bn (Turkey’s expected to hit 60bn)
2. Liquid reserves are similar – 30-40bn in each
3. Egypt has other financing needs of 11bn vs 55bn in Turkey
4. Big difference is Egyptian debt/GDP is 85% vs ~30% for Turkey (excluding all of the FX obligations owed domestically)
5. Turkey’s GDP is also 2x Egypt’s at 800bn

Turkey is a much more professionally run country (excluding the President), with a functioning banking sector and deep relationships with Europe.

Erdogan has also been democratically elected and has a mandate. There’s lots of technical factors that favored Erdogan (media ownership, etc), and his policies are illiberal, but it’s clear that he has the support of a large share of the country. Egypt, on the other hand, is a police state which overthrew its first democratically elected president in 2013. The economy has been run by the military for 70 years and was a Kingdom subordinated to the UK before that. They don’t have buy-in from the public and can’t just “let the FX go”, as Turkey will likely have to.
