Takeaways
Non renewable are stock limited. Renewable are flow limited.  You need to identify the behaviors and what to restrain.

Non linearities can cause one loop to become dominant over another. Most complexities occur at the boundaries between one system and another, e.g. a company’s invested capital and its customers’ total wealth.

Determine what stocks are limiting factors, and focus on the flows for that stock. 

When others' actions seem irrational, understand what their constraints are. What's driving them?

Think about what different management teams and governments are optimizing for. What are their goals?

There may be multiple systems operating, but in different timescales. 







This book attempts to abstract common observances into different systems. All are some combination of stocks and flows which interact with each other using either balancing or feedback loops. The author argues that if you see the underlying structure in a system, you can recognize patterns. There are common methods to improve systems that can be applied to different domains. Explaining behavior often comes down to understanding what the required "inflows" are, and what is limiting. Its focus on constraints to explain behavior reminded me of [[Geopoltical Alpha]].
If something persists, it's likely because of its underlying structure rather than the personalities involved. 

**System Structure**
Every system has elements, connections, and a purpose. Do the elements act differently due to connections? Does behavior persist regardless of external circumstances. Changing elements completely often won’t change system behavior. You can try changing one at a time and observing, what happens. The purpose is often the least looked at and the biggest driver.
  
System stocks are accumulation of some value that can be observed. Stocks are accumulation of flows. The current memory of past flows (and predictor of future flows?). This applicable to the firm; FCF are inflows and debt maturities are outflows. For Sovereigns, there are the accumulation and usage of reserves. A change in outflow can be equivalent to change in inflow in terms of the effect on the stock. 

Inventories are a subsystem in the broader firm-system. Stocks change slowly because flows take time. This can give you a cover as you wait for it to change. Policies and reactions tend to be based on stocks. Inflows and outflows are often decoupled, which is accomplished through stocks, acting as a buffer. Most decisions are meant to regulate stocks.

**Loops and Reaction Functions**

The world is a collection of feedback loops. If a behavior persists, it's likely because of a feedback loop. Feedback means the stock level influences decisions on inflows or outflows. For example, a lower bank balance causes you to save more. Balancing or goal seeking loops bring the system to an equilibrium and counteract flows or imbalances. For example, a hot coffee in a cold room, will get cooler until its temperature equals that of the room. The rate of change decreases as the delta narrows.

The other kind of loop is self reinforcing- vicious or virtuous circles where the stock can replicate itself. For example, population growth, compounding interest etc. It's important to identify and differentiate between these loops. The exception to loops would be systems where the flows are independent of the stock level. 

If A causes B think whether the reverse is also true. More revenue will increase the stock of assets, but the reverse isn't necessarily true.  

**Zoo of Systems**

May have multiple systems operating at the same time. A thermostat is keeping the house warm in a feedback loop. But if there’s a leak, the inside temperature is getting closer to outside temperature in a balancing loop. A big delta will force big temperature drops which will require big furnace increases and could blow a fuse 

What are examples of that? Growing debt service will drain assets. The firm may respond by increasing prices. Past a certain point, the consumer will turn away.  

Any changes you make to a system can only affect future behavior which sounds obvious, but it means there will always be delays. New inflows don’t react to outflows but to stock levels. So there’s a delay driven by the stock size. This is a key point. In the firm example, assets are the buffer. You're also paid to wait through carry received on the stock or bonds; is the carry sufficient given the stock size?

That’s why the real economy doesn’t react immediately to changes in price. You need to take into account outflows when determining appropriate inflows. 

Many systems have both types of loops. For example, population has a reinforcing loop (birth rates) and a balancing loop (death rates). The interplay between the two determines if there's exponential growth or if people will die off. You need to determine which loop dominates.  

When examining systems, one should look at: 

What are the drivers?  Will they affect the loop as predicted?
Are drivers themselves affected by the stock?
Are they part of their own loops?
What’s driving the drivers and are they part of the same system i.e. dependent on the stock?

***Economic capital***

Reinvestment is like the birth rate and is reinforcing. Depreciation is a balancing loop like the death rate.  

Combining this with a population system, development is about growing a reinvestment loop faster than the birthrate loop, i.e. growing GDP per capita.   

At some point a reinforcing loop will hit a balancing loop; this is the limits to growth archetype. 
Balancing loops constrain growth. E.g. capital reinvestment is reinforcing so energy companies will generate more revenue and profit. But the wells are finite and hence subject to a balancing loop. 
Each subsequent barrel is more expensive to drill so profit per barrel goes down which will limit profit. You’ll hence stop drilling sooner than you thought. This is true in general for finite resources. You’ll reach the point of diminishing returns faster than the size of the resource would imply. Due to exponential growth of reinvestment, even doubling the resource won’t add much time to reserve length because of diminishing returns. If an explorer chooses a slower growth rate the resource will obviously last longer. If the lower supply also leads to higher prices then the point of diminishing returns will shift forward as it becomes possible to go after the last mile. This is also true if technology brings extraction costs down over time.  

**Renewables**

*Fisheries* 
Constrained by overfishing after which reproduction slows. If markets continue to fund fishing even as the population goes down, and it becomes less economical, the whole thing collapses. This is what's happened with shale drilling. If it slows, it will limit the overfishing, in line with the population decline and could lead to a gradual depletion. If the capital cycle is too slow to reprice,  the renewable resource actually becomes non renewable.  

Non renewable are stock limited. Renewable are flow limited.  You need to identify the behaviors and what to restrain. 


**Part 2**

We respond to events but those are just snapshots. You need to understand the system's structure - stocks, flows, feedback loops, hierarchies etc. We tend to overemphasize flows over stocks. You need to understand how stocks affect flows through feedback mechanisms. Looking for how one flow affects another is the wrong question as there may not be a relationship. 

*Where are non linearities*

Non linearities can cause one loop to become dominant over another. Most complexities occur at the boundaries between one system and another, e.g. a company’s invested capital and its customers’ total wealth.

It's not always clear where to draw boundaries between systems, but you need to somewhere. You should be guided by whether the other stock will affect the flows you care about in the given timeframe. 

You  need to figure out what are the binding constraints. Which stocks are limiting? Then focus on the flows for that stock. The limiting factors will change with time, and growth will also change which factors are limiting. You need to understand this process. All systems have delays which are driven by stocks. It's necessary to understand what your relevant time frame is and pay attention to oscillations in that same frame. Ignore others.

Delays affect policies and lead to oscillations and overshoots. Germany’s reunification is still having impacts because of delays.

Bounded rationality leads to mistakes but it’s also ever present. Overinvesting, tragedy of the commons etc. You need to put yourself in the shoes of other actors to predict bounded rationality and understand their incentives. Eg why do consumers overspend? Why does the Fed under tighten and over tighten. One must understand their constraints, limited info, goals, etc.


**Chapter 5**

**Archetypes**  

*Policy failure systems*

This is composed of various balancing loops that push back on each other. Eg war on drugs. The police cut supply which raises prices and further empowers cartels. They push back harder to get supply in. The harder one side pushes the harder the resistance. The solution may be to stop pushing and understand what everyone’s incentives are and why they’re acting the way they are. See the system as a whole and come up with a solution for all subsystems. Stop expensing effort by pushing against resistance.

**Tragedy of the commons**

A finite resource which everyone is incentivized to exploit. It's caused by a delay in the response between using up the stock and the response. Eg if grazing on a piece of land, the productivity per unit doesn’t fall immediately. The delay between the use of resource and growth of users using the resource. 

Three solutions:

1) Moral suasion - doesn’t often work because people ignore it
2) Privatize - tie consequences to your usage - this maybe impossible depending on the resource
3) Regulate - eg a bank. You can’t take other people’s money and in exchange yours is protected. This requires enforcement, and regulations need to be mutually agreed upon.
 

**Drifting systems**

For example, losing market share continuously. This stems from the discrepancy between perceived and actual state. An actor dismisses good news and overplays bad news; he lowers standards. The worse perceived state leads to a worse actual state and so on. E.g. YoY comp sales fall into this trap. You need instead to anchor on best results or remember how things used to be, which will make the reinforcing loop positive. Keeping the standards absolute rather than relative to past results may help. 


**Competitive exclusion** 
Success flows to the successful. A reinforcing loop where there are increasing returns to scale. Rich people can get richer by accumulated privilege. This leads to monopolies in industries, and increasing returns on invested capital. Need policies like taxes or antitrust laws to level playing field.  

**Addictive loops**
Reliance on government subsidies (or low interest rates). Reliance on fertilizer or actual drugs. Capital inflows for EM i.e. carry trades as a system [[The Rise of Carry]]. There’s a stock - drugs, global liquidity etc. Another stock is the system's internal capacity. It’s not at the state you want so you seek some intervention i.e. inflows. That further diminishes systems capacity as it becomes reliant on those inflows and so on. This distracts you from solving the real problem. Withdrawal could be the carry crash or being forced to deal with problems previously ignored. Should work to build own capacity rather than relying on easy interventions. This is the argument that Xi makes when they refuse to use fiscal stimulus. Easy inflows disguise the real problem and make them harder to solve. Systems' natural loops will atrophy over time, and you should focus on LT solutions to build capacity.  

**Rule beating** 

Complying with the letter but not the spirit of the law, e.g. depositing just under 20k. When you set rules or goals or metrics, the system will optimize towards that goal. Think about effects on subsystems and why there may be incentives to cheat. The goals you define will set behavior, e.g. if you measure quality of schools by test results. The key point is pay attention to the metrics used. 
Maybe economic performance should be measured by capital stock subject to the least GDP, I.e. get the most wealth with the least throughout. Think about what different management teams and governments are optimizing for. What are their goals? If rule breaking is happening, understand why. You’re moving against some counterforce. Is the system optimizing for a different rule than you had in mind. Both rule breaking and optimizing for a different goal can happen at the same time. Excessive optimizing to rules especially bad rules makes the system more brittle, and it will  likely to fail if the rules change.  

**Leverage points**

The One thing to change in a complex system is often counterintuitive. All of the attention goes to inputs i.e. parameters even though you have the least leverage over them and they likely won’t change the overall system. 

*Buffers - size of stocks*
Reduces volatility but are expensive to maintain, e.g. large inventory. They're normally physical and hard to change so not a great leverage point.  

*Underlying plumbing of stocks and flows* 
Important but tough to change after.

*Delays*
Strong leverage points but hard to change. Can cause an overreaction if too short and may fall below critical threshold levels and cause excess volatility If too long. These are also hard to change. It may be easier and more useful to increase delays.  

*Balancing feedback loops*
These are key to keeping a system functioning. Interventions like subsidies often weaken these loops making system more vulnerable 

*Reinforcing feedback loops*
It's often easier to slow these than to strengthen balancing loops.  

*Info flows*
Adding info flows may be a powerful leverage point. They may explain delays and are much cheaper to change. However some info flows have perverse impacts, e.g. communicating that a resource is getting scarce, may encourage more activity. A better leverage point is rules as they control what people optimize on.  

*Self organization* 
What are the goals of a system? Don’t confuse them with the rules. A corporation may be maximizing earnings per rules but the goal is market share. 

Changing actors often doesn’t matter except for person at the top who can change rules and the goals. Paradigms form systems through agreed upon norms and goals. Change the paradigm by modeling the system and taking yourself out of it. We tend to over focus on what’s measurable and not what’s hard to quantify; the latter may be more important. 

It's important to watch how a system works and not impose previous biases. Write down your model of a system.  

Systems that are intrinsically responsible, that is, where the decision maker bears the cost of a poorly run system. For example, privatizing the commons
