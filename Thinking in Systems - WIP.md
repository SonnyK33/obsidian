Which systems are hard to tell apart and are often confused for one another? Is there an opportunity there? 
How to identify different systems? Which part to start from? 
Can one transform into another?

A sector within an economy 


This book attempts to abstract common observances into different systems. All are some combination of stocks and flows which interact with each other using either balancing or feedback loops. The author argues that if you see the underlying structure in a system, you can recognize patterns. There are common methods to improve systems that can be applied to different domains. Explaining behavior often comes down to understanding what the required "inflows" are, and what is limiting. Its focus on constraints to explain behavior reminded me of [[Geopoltical Alpha]].
If something persists, it's likely because of its underlying structure rather than the personalities involved. 

**System Structure**
Every system has elements, connections, and a purpose. Do the elements act differently due to connections? Does behavior persist regardless of external circumstances. Changing elements completely often won’t change system behavior. You can try changing one at a time and observing, what happens. The purpose is often the least looked at and the biggest driver.
  
System stocks are accumulation of some value that can be observed. Stocks are accumulation of flows. The current memory of past flows (and predictor of future flows?). This applicable to the firm; FCF are inflows and debt maturities are outflows. For Sovereigns, there are the accumulation and usage of reserves. A change in outflow can be equivalent to change in inflow in terms of the effect on the stock. 

Inventories are a subsystem in the broader firm-system. Stocks change slowly because flows take time. This can give you a cover as you wait for it to change. Policies and reactions tend to be based on stocks. Inflows and outflows are often decoupled, which is accomplished through stocks, acting as a buffer. Most decisions are meant to regulate stocks.

**Loops and Reaction Functions**

The world is a collection of feedback loops

If a behavior persists likely because of a feedback 

Feedback means the stock level influences decisions on inflows or outflows

Less bank balance causes you to save more

Balancing or goal seeking loops bring to an equilibrium and counteract flows or imbalances 

Eg hot coffee in cold room 

The rate of change decreases as the delta narrows

Other kind of loop is self reinforcing- vicious or virtuous circles where the stock can replicate itself 

Population growth, compounding interest etc 

Should differentiate between balancing and reinforcing loops 

  

Feedback loops are everywhere

The exception would be flows that are independent of the stock level

  

If A causes B think whether the reverse is also true 

  

Zoo of systems

May have multiple at same time 

Thermostat is keeping house warm in a feedback loop

But if there’s a leak, inside temperature is getting closer to outside temperature in

A balancing loop

A big delta will force big temperature drops which will require big furnace increases and could blow a fuse 

What are examples of that ?

  

Any changes you make to system can only affect future behavior which sounds obvious but means there will always be delays 

  

New inflows don’t react to outflows but to stock levels 

So there’s a delay driven by stock size

That’s why real economy doesn’t react immediately to change in price

Need to take into account outflows when determining appropriate inflows

  

Many systems have both loops

Eg population has a reinforximg loop - birth rates and a balancing loop - death rates 

Interplay determines if exponential growth or ppl die off 

Need to determine which loop dominates 

  

When examining systems 1

What are drivers?  Will they affect the loop as predicted?

Are drivers themselves affected by the stock?

Are they part of their own loops?

What’s driving the drivers and are they part of the same system ie dependent on the stock?

Are they part of their own cycles?

  

Economic capital -

Reinvestment is like birth rate and is reinforcing 

Depreciation is balancing loop like death rate 

The former has dominated 

  

Combining this w population system - dev is about growing reinvestment loop faster that birthrate loop 

  

Inventory example

New orders are based on potential sales

Delays and uncertainty create bullwhip

Try to understand different retailers’ inventory system

How long is delay? How are they making decisions on new orders?

What are delays from factory? How long do they wait to change policies?

At some point a reinforcing loop will hit a balancing loop - limits to growth archetype 

B loops constrain growth 

  

Eg capital reinvestment is reinforcing so go energy company will lead to more revenue and profit 

But the wells are finite and hence subject to a balancing loop

Each subsequent barrel is more expensive to drill so profit per bareelll goes down which will limit profit 

You’ll hence stop drilling sooner than you thought 

True in general for finite resources 

You’ll reach the point of diminishing returns faster than the size of the resource would imply 

Due to exponential growth of reinvestment, even doubling the resource won’t add much time to reserve length bc of diminishing returns

If an explorer chooses a slower growth rate the resource will obviously last longer

If the lower supply also leads to higher prices then the point of diminishing returns will shift forward as it becomes possible to go after the last Mile 

Same if technology brings extraction costs down over time 

  

Renewables

Fisheries example - constrained by the point of overfishing after which reproduction slows and the speed of the capital cycle. If markets continue to fund fishing even as the population goes down and it becomes less economical the whole thing collapses

If it slows it will limit the overfishing in line with the population decline and could lead to a gradual depletion

If the capital cycle is too slow to reprice or efficiently increases the renewable resource actually becomes non renewable

  

Non renewable are stock limited

Renewable are flow limited 

Need to identify the behaviors and what to restrain 

  

Part 2

We respond to events but those are just snapshots 

Need to understand the systems structure - stocks, flows, feedback loops, hierarchies etc

  

Tend to overemphasize flows over stocks 

Need to understand how stocks affect flows through feedback mechanisms 

Looking for how one flow affects another is the wrong question as there may not be a relationship 

  

Where are non linearities

Non linearities can cause one loop to become dominant over another

  

The most complexities occur at the boundaries between one system and another 

Eg a company’s invested capital and its customers’ total wealth 

  

Not always clear where to draw boundaries between systems 

Need to draw line somewhere

Should be guided by whether the other stock will affect the flows you care about in the given timeframe

  

Need to figure out what are the binding constrains

Which stocks are limiting?

Then flocks on the flows for that stock

Limiting factors will change with time

Growth will also change which factors are limiting 

Need to understand this process

All systems have delays which are driven by stocks 

Need to understand what your relevant time frame is and pay attention to oscillations in that same frame 

Ignore others 

  

Delays affect policyies and lead to oscillations and overshoots

Germany’s reunification is till having impacts because of delays

Need to assess delays 

  

Bounded rationality leads to mistakes but it’s also ever present 

Overinvesting, tragedy of the commons etc

Need to put yourself in the shoes of other actors to predict bounded rationality and understand their incentives 

Eg why do consumers overspend? Why does the Fed under tighten and over tighten 

Need to understand their constraints, limited info, goals, etc 

  

Chapter 5

Archetypes - 

Policy failure systems

Composed of various balancing loops that push back on each other 

Eg war on drugs 

Police cut supply which raises prices and further empowers cartels 

Who push back harder to get supply in 

Harder one side pushes the harder the resistance 

Solution may be to stop pushing and understand what everyone’s incentives are and why they’re acting the way they are

See system as a whole and come up w solution for all subsystems

Stop expensing effort pushing against resistance

Tragedy of the commons

Finite resource which everyone is incentivized to exploit

Caused by a delay in the response between using  up the stock and the response

Eg if grazing on a piece of land, the productivity per unit doesn’t fall immediately

Delay bw use of resource and growth of users using the resource.

  

3 solutions

Moral suasion - doesn’t often work bc ppl ignore

Privatize - tie consequences to your usage - maybe impossible depending on resource

Regulate - eg a bank. You can’t take other people’s money and in exchange yours is protected 

Need enforcement eg police and laws 

Regulations need to be mutually agreeed upon 

  

Drifting systems

Eg losing market share continuously 

Discrepancy from perceived and actual state

Actor dismisses good news and overplays bad news

Lowers standards

Worse perceived state leads to worse actual state and so on

Reinforcing loop 

Boiler frog syndrome 

YoY comp sales fall into this trap

Need instead to anchor on best results or remember how things used to be 

Makes the reinforcing loop positive

Should keep standards absolute

Escalation systems - arms race, price war etc 

Need to come to an agreement and regulate actions 

Negotiate a new loop w balancing mechanisms 

Unilaterally disarm

  

Competitive exclusion - success to the successful 

Reinforcing loop

Rich people can get richer by accumulated privilege 

Leads to monopolies in industries - increasing returns to scale and returns on invested capital 

Need policies like taxes or antitrust laws to level playing field

  

Addictive loops

Reliance on govt subsidies

Subsidies like social security

Fertilizer 

Actual drugs 

Capital inflows for EM ie carry trades as a system 

  

There’s a stock - drugs, global liquidity etc

Another stock is systems internal capacity

It’s not at the state you want so you seek some intervention ie inflows

That further diminishes systems capacity as it becomes reliant on those inflows and so on

Distracts you from solving real problem

Withdrawal=carry crash ie dealing w problems prev ignored 

Should work to build own capacity rather than relying on easy interventions - see this w China 

Easy inflows disguise the real problem and make them harder to solve 

Systems natural loops atrophy - should focus on LT solutions to  build capacity 

  

Rule beating 

Complying w letter but not spirit of law

Eg depositing just under 20k

When you set rules or goals or metrics, system will optimize towards that goal

Think about effects on subsystems and why there may be incentives to cheat 

Goals you define will set behavior 

Eg if you measure quality of schools by test results 

Key point is pay attention to the metrics used 

Maybe economic performance should be measured by capital stock subject to the least GDP

Ie get the most wealth with the least throughout 

Think about what different management teams and governments are optimizing for 

What are their goals 

  

If rule breaking is happening, understand why 

You’re moving against some counterforce 

  

Is system optimizing for a different rule than you had in mind 

Both rule breaking and optimizing for a different goal can happen at the same time

Excessive optimizing to rules esp bad rules makes the system more

Brittle 

And likely to fail if rules change 

  

Leverage points

One thing to change in a complex system - often counterintuitive 

All of the attention goes to inputs ie parameters even though least leverage over them and they likely won’t change overall system 

  

Buffers - size of stocks

Reduces volatility but are expensive to maintain 

Eg large inventory 

Normally physical and hard to change so not great leverage point 

  

Underlying plumbing of stocks and flows 

Important but tough to change after

Delays

Strong leverage points but hard to change

Cause overreaction if too short and may fall below critical threshold levels and cause excess volatility If too long

But hard to change 

May be easier and more useful to increase delays at Times

  

Balancing feedback loops

These are key to keep system functioning 

Interventions like subsidies often weaken these loops making system more vulnerable 

Leverage is keeping these loops

  

Reinforcing feedback loops

Often easier to slow these then strengthen balancing loops

  

Info flows

Adding info flows powerful leverage point 

May explain delays and much cheaper to change

Some info flows have perverse impacts 

Eg communicating that a resource is getting scarce, may encourage more activity 

  

Better leverage point is rules as they control what people optimize on 

  

Self organization - power to change structure

What are the goals of a system

Don’t confuse w rules

Corp may be maximizing earnings per rules but the goal is market share 

  

Changing actors often doesn’t matter except for person at the top who can change rules and goals 

  

Paradigms form systems through agreed upon norms and goals

Change paradigm by modeling system and taking yourself out of it

Tend to over focus on what’s measurable and not what’s hard to quantify 

Latter may be more important 

  

Need to watch how system works not impose previous biases

  

Write down model of system 

  

Credit sits on larger stock than equity so moves slower

Systems that are intrinsically responsible - the decision maker bears the cost of a

Poorly run system 

Ie privatizing the commons 

  

What systems are operating in short term cycles vs long
