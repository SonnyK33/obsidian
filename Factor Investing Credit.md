- one of the main differences from factor investing in equities is illiquidity and transaction costs
- any useful strategy would need to exclude illiquid bond
- the "market factor" which is normally the first principal component for equity factor investing is unlikely to explain most of the variance for a credit portfolio due to differences in credit quality, duration, etc 
- factors identified by Barclays - 
	- ESP - excess spread - spread unexplained by fundamentals
	- spread per unit of leverage
	- using equity momentum (strong relationship between equity performance and future bond performance)
- an allocation strategy that buys sectors that showed strong equity momentum outperforms indices 

**Factors**
Value Investing - 
- typically uses spread as measure of value
- simply over-weighting high spread bonds will obviously lead to a riskier portfolio and will be overweighted towards certain sectors, ratings, etc 
- need to control for industry, duration, quality, and issuer fundamentals 
- compare individual bonds with peer group average (which is considered the true fundamental value)
	- control for credit quality (ratings), industry, and duration
	- can combine ratings criteria with specific fundamental inputs (e.g. leverage, margins, etc)
	- need to have a liquidity screen as well - issue size, recently issued, and/or filetered using axes data 
- strategy relies on mean reversion in spreads
	- buying bonds that are cheaper (controlling for other factors) which you expect to gain in value and (vice versa) only works when spreads mean revert
	- if cheap bonds keep getting cheaper strategy doesn't work
	- tends to work best when dispersion is high 
- bonds that screen the worst on these criteria may actually be the most liquid (hence trading at lower spread), so screening for liquidity is important
- bonds that screen the best may have higher liquidity than bonds in between as they have idiosyncratic factors 
- one strategy is to buy bonds with scores above median and sell those below median - this results in higher turnover
- could reduce turnover by focusing on bonds at the extreme end, or only reblancing after a bond falls above/below a higher/lower threshold (i.e. selling a bond when it falls below 40th percentile)
	- this may result in a higher volatilitity portfolio





**Ideas**
- track equity performance of different sectors and measure against credit performance
