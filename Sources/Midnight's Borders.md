Border's are arbitrary and shouldn't be taken for granted. They often mask social discontent and centuries-old conflicts. Lately we've seen the adverse effects from removing borders - the EU for example. Globalization also intends to remove the constraints from borders. Creating and removing borders are difficult to engineer properly - when is the former worse than the latter. Or rather, under which conditions are new borders likely to create conflict versus removing borders?


Summary - 
What stories does the current map tell you? Borders are a reflection of political and social struggles. They're mostly created without the permission of the inhabitants and as such, have lasting implications. 

Author travels throughout India, telling the stories of the people who reside in border communities. The book focuses on people whose lives have been adversely affected by arbitrary borders, most of which were create by imperial powers. The overarching message of the book is that physical borders are often arbitrary and always violent. [[india - Outline]] as a unified state did not exist prior to the British creating it.

**Intro**
Modern India is a British creation whose borders are artificial. Despite the multi-ethnic history of the land, Modi is attempting to codify India as a Hindu state. The latest example is the CAA laws which make it harder for non-Hindus to retain citizenship. These are the Indian equivalent of the Nuremberg laws in Germany.  People from border communities frequently lack identification, especially the poor. Modi started a program to give unique IDs to all cows in India. At the same time as many border residents lack any ID and are harassed for it - and called illegal. Their carved up homelands made them stateless .

There's been an increase in Indian asylum seekers flying to Central America and then heading to the US. Majoritarian values have made it into the constitution, and the Supreme Court has allowed Ram to be invoked in property disputes.   

The roots of an ethnostate didn't start with Modi. Even Gandhi revoked Ram ie hinduism as an icon of India.

The Durand, Radcliffe, and McMahon lines divide India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh. Notice the names of the lines - not indigenous to the region.

The Book is a critique of the modern nation state and its arbitrary borders.   

 
**Afghanistan-Pakistan**
The Durand line divides Pakistan from Afghanistan. It was created by British to protect British India from the Russian threat. Afghanistan does not recognize this border but Pakistan does. The Sikh empire was defeated by the East India company and Kashmiri people were sold to the (Hindu) dogras - who mistreated the people. This is commemorated in the shawl weavers protest.   

During partition, the Dogras massacred Muslims causing them to flee. A Patan rebellion from Pakistan attempted to take the territory, and so the  King got assistance from Indian troops and signed an agreement which partitioned Kashmir.   

Afghanistan was treated as a buffer between British India and Russia. The Durand line was never meant as a sovereign border but rather a line between zones of influence. Afghanis went from fighting the British to the soviets to the Taliban and were called heroes and then terrorists depending on the time. Most didn’t know who they were fighting; people signed on for guns and food. Upon Indian independence, Pashtuns could choose bw India and pak but independence wasn’t an option. Pakistan considers the Durand line to be legitimate.   

**India-China**
A common strategy is to recruit from a disputed area (like Nagaland) to police another (like the border with China). The border with China - was decided by British and Tibetan officials. Chinese never agreed to it. 
  



**India-Myanmar**
Nagas are the oldest independence movement in India. Nellie, a town in assam, is the site of the largest one day massacre - 3k ppl in one day. India changed the citizenship act so that at least one parent had to be a citizen, in order to qualify. Large portions of some villages in Assam hurt by massacres were excluded from citizenship. The Rohingya are the worlds largest stateless groupa and are excluded from Burmese citizenship .  

**India-Pakistan**
Radcliffe, who drew the border, only had a couple weeks for work. He burned notes afterwards. This remains one of the bloodiest clashes of all time - 2m people were killed immediately after partition.   

Poor people in border areas with Bangladesh are often called d-voters for dubious or doubtful. They have to prove their citizenship but lack papers or any proof of where they were born. They’re harassed by the police and forced to hire expensive lawyers.   

There's a long history of oppression in Kashmir - by the Mughals, sheikhs, afghans and finally the dogras. Encounter killings where the military executes a civilian and then fabricates a pre text are common in Kashmir, even as armed militancy has gone down. The focus on Pakistan as the enemy erases role and perspective of Kashmiris   

The autho recalls  the story of a woman named Sari from Rajasthan. She experienced the worst of India in her own village. Her father threatened Muslims in the region during partition and ended up kidnapping and raping a 14 year old - her mother . Her mother was returned to Pakistan for a ransom. Her father was killed in relation for what he did during partition. Later the Indian army built a bunker on her land without her permission.    

Pakistan didn’t have a constitution or civil society post partition like India did and hence minority and womens rights were not respected. India took this for granted - ironically, Modi is taking back many of the rights earned during the post partition period. Gandhi’s assassin’s pic is now in parliament. 

Jinnah wanted a secular Pakistan but many of his speeches from back them are memory - holed. Indians today should learn from what Pakistan went through under military dictatorship
