Summary: Markets are driven by liquidity flows--the sum of savings and credit that flow through the global system. The goal of liquidity today is primarily to refinance existing obligations rather than fund new capex. The main sources of liquidity today are the central banks - especially the Fed and PBOC. In the past (especially pre-2008), the Eurodollar market was the marginal source.

China today accounts for  1/3 of  global liquidity and has the express goal of displacing the dollar - especially in Asia. Its belt and road initiative is a key part of this, as are central bank swap lines with other Asian central banks. China allowed its currency to weaken, thus benefitting its exports. However, as central banks started tightening this year (and corresponding with the war between Russia and Ukraine), it has had to defend its currency. Japan hasn't changed its yield curve control policies and hence the Yen has been in free fall. Curiously, the US hasn't objected to this. This is part of a larger conflict between China and the US. The world is increasingly moving into two spheres - one led by the US, the other by China. This is similar to the Bretton Woods 1 scheme, which excluded the Soviet Union and CHina. 

China is attempting to internationalize the Yuan with the belt and road initiative and with swap lines with other Asian central banks. They don't want to completely open their capital markets as are afraid of capital fleeing. They want the best of both - closed markets for domestic capital and a convertible current account. 

Western central banks were afraid of deflation and so lowered rates - this has led to excess leverage. Walter bagehot - writing Lombard street - argued that central banks should lend at higher rates against good collateral at times of crisis. It was the first treatise on what central banks should do.


- Liquidity is the sum of savings and credit flowing thru system - not just money supply
	- Is the capacity of the  financial system to refinance itself 
	- Not financing capex as not much capex done in west anymore 
	- 70trillion in debt principal due every year vs 10tr of new capex spending 
- Central banks now the marginal source of liquidity whereas pre GFC the offshore market esp Eurodollars was
- PBOC controls domestic system the way BOJ did in the 80/s and the way BOK controls Korean - thru window guidance - telling banks how much they can lend 
- Chinese liquidity is 1/3 of global total even bigger than US
