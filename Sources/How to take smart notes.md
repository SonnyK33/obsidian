[[To do - Outline]]
- need an outline of how I will traverse the slipbox to develop pieces of writing. See "writing process" below.



Nothing counts other than writing. This is the key message from the book. Writng is necessary for systematic thinking and for organizing recently learned material. Everything should be read with the understanding that you will want to write about it in the future. This mindset will make you a better reader and listener as it makes you more deliberate in what you focus on. Read with the purpose of writing and with connecting the material with previous knowledge.

The intermediary between reading (as well as listening or watching new material) and writing is the slipbox. A physical (or in my case a piece of software) that stores notes and connects then. Thes slipbox is not a directory system with different topics (although topics are addressed separately). When adding a new note to the slipbox, instead of thinking what topic a note should be stored under, think about the context in which you’d want to see the note again. This way the database gets more useful the more notes you have - the value isn't just from the note but from its connections with the previous notes and new insights developed.  

Types of notes:
- fleeting (stored in my email)
- literature (source notes)
- permanent notes - generally called molecules or atoms in this system

It's important to review fleeting notes as often as possible - within a day if possible. Once they become permanent notes, they should be useful even if you forgot where they came from. If you don't plan on coming back to the note, don’t write it down. That is, only write what is useful to your current line of thinking. Why are you reading this? That question should guide what you write.  

Permanent notes are formed by reading fleeting notes and thinking about what they mean to you and how they fit with the rest of your notes. Permanent notes should be standardIzed in format and kept in one place (i.e. the slipbox). They should be capable of being part of or inspire a unique piece of writing - which should be the end goal of all notes. In my case, the piece of writing could be a trade or thematic write-up. Others could become part of my newsletter. 

My slipbox notes:
- source (like this one)
- atoms (some piece of knowledge which could be in multiple sources)
- molecule (some unique insight - these should be the goal)
- outline (a way of organizing multiple notes)

  
**Writing Process**
Writing is not a linear process - it’s circular and only happens after immersing yourself in your own writing and thoughts. You never actually starting from scratch, and with the slipbox, your problem shouldn’t be finding a topic to write about but rather having too many topics.

Placing facts into writing will be natural as they're easier to remember if they're linked with others. As you combine notes with others, contradictions or implications will become obvious. It will allow you to see fully drawn out lines of reasoning, and writing an outline, and then a manuscript will be the next natural step. This method allows for tighter feedback loops - every time you put a concept in your own writing or link it with other notes, its value for future writing becomes apparent. This should make the process more enjoyable as every note propels the learning further than the last one. 

  

Multitasking is always a bad idea as it actually makes it harder to accomplish multiple things. This is also true for when you try to store multiple newly learned concepts in your head at once. The slipbox's focus on writing makes it easier to focus on one thing at a time. It should allow you to toggle between extreme focus on one thing and playful exploration/associations between multiple ideas (stored in slipbox) when writing a piece of work. You'll be able to focus on important tasks if less important issues are dealt with - that is, added to your slip box. 

The only unfinished takes that should be left in your short term memory are the most important ones. Your brain will keep thinking about the most important unfinished tasks, and you'll be able to focus on one thing at a time.  

  ***Start here***


Always read w a pen in hand 

Read w an aim to understand and put into your own words 

Read w the goal of connecting the material w previous notes

A text on a new topic will require more extensive notes as you’ll need to write more to understand the material 

Purpose of notes is to facilitate next step - writing the literature and permanent notes

Focus on the structure or theory of the writing

Literature notes should focus on the main points and what they mean to you

Handwritten notes more likely to be remembered bc it takes longer to write them and so you focus on understanding vs completionism 

  

We’re more likely to remember facts that confirm what we already think

When writing if you start w a hypothesis and topic more likely to exclude info that opposes hypothesis and so should instead do so from bottoms up

Info chosen based on relevance not on fitting beliefs 

  

Learn (by practice) to take concise notes which capture the gist of a text 

One way is to focus and write about what a concept does not mean and compare it to similar or opposite concepts

Writing proves to yourself that you understand something 

Easier to fool yourself when just giving an oral explanation as can use non-verbal cues or “know what I mean” which you can’t use in writing. 

  

Dividing content into disparate topics and modules (like units at school) doesn’t help one understand underlying concepts

Attempting to recall what you’ve read is the best way to remember something (this is in ultra learning as well)

  

Writing to elaborate - take notes and then elaborate on what you read (connect to other pieces, what does it mean to you etc) allows you to remember and contextualize what you read

  

When reading, do so with questions in mind about what you’re reading. Don’t just stay within the writer’s context but focus on the limitations of what you’re reading and how it differs what you know. Must think beyond the given context of a piece of information. Think about how it connects with other info and how it may answer other questions beyond what the author presents. In the slip box, these contextual notes should

Be made) and explicitly connected with other notes to form molecules.


Can’t think systematically without writing 

It isn’t just a record of your thinking but the thinking itself 

For a group of literature notes, the first permanent note could be “why are these notes relevant to my current research?” And “why”, further ones 

- how are these notes connected w others

Are these ideas discussed elsewhere? Why or why not?

Check if any of These questions relate to what’s already in slipbox 

  

Shouldn’t aim to remember isolated facts but rather to build connections 

Only so many facts you can remember anyways


Elaboration as a learning and remembering method

What does a note mean? How is it similar or different from other notes? What are its implications etc? Other contexts?

Elaborating on a note is key to understanding 

  

Keywords or hashtags can be used as a way to find a given note but you should be stingy w the number of such keywords

The connections to other notes is much more important 

Hashtags should

Be picked based on your current interests ie when will you want to see this note?

From the perspective of a writer not an archivist 

  

For topics,

Can make a new note which gives an outline of the structure of an argument w links to other notes

Should be edited as you see fit

  

Four types of cross references

1) outline notes - as described above - an entry note to a topic with links to other notes 

Should also give an overview of a topic 

I could use one for trade generations

2 note to note links

Most common

Start to see patterns if multiple links bw different topics

When going through notes,

Look for paradoxes, similarities, comparable mental models from different contexts

Works better if permanent notes focus on abstractions and models vs just summaries

Insights should be in molecules

  

Assemble a toolkit of mental models in a variety of disciplines 

Will remember content better if sits on web of these models 

Understanding something requires you to compare it similar or different concepts 

  

Making abstractions from your notes and reading is key 

Relating concepts from different disciplines requires abstractions 

Solving creative problems relies on abstracting and finding similar problems or relating to an event in history

Simplify complex

Topics as much as possible

What does the text not say 

  

Be as systematic w format and organization as possible

Make templates for different types of notes

One idea per note and should fit on screen 

Restricting format allows focus on content 

  

By looking at clusters of notes can decide what to write about 

Think of follow up questions and structure into chapters and finally a manuscript 

  

Good way to find things you’re actually interested in 

You also know that the topic is writeable based on all of the links

By elaborating on what you read, can develop new 

Interests as you go

  

When turning into manuscript look at outline visually

Decide

Which notes shouldn’t be in draft - problem

Becomes too much to write about

Work on Multiple manuscripts at once - when you get stuck on one move to another 

That’s real strength of seeing different notes tied to one another

Read w pen in hand and the ideas will come to you 

Make smart notes and writing will come naturally
