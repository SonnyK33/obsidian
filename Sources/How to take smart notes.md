[[To do - Outline]]
- need an outline of how I will traverse the slipbox to develop pieces of writing. See "writing process" below.


**Slipbox Structure**  
Nothing counts other than writing. This is the key message from the book. Writng is necessary for systematic thinking and for organizing recently learned material. Everything should be read with the understanding that you will want to write about it in the future. This mindset will make you a better reader and listener as it makes you more deliberate in what you focus on. Read with the purpose of writing it in your own words and with connecting the material with previous knowledge.

The intermediary between reading (as well as listening or watching new material) and writing is the slipbox. A physical (or in my case a piece of software) that stores notes and connects then. Thes slipbox is not a directory system with different topics (although topics are addressed separately). When adding a new note to the slipbox, instead of thinking what topic a note should be stored under, think about the context in which you’d want to see the note again. This way the database gets more useful the more notes you have - the value isn't just from the note but from its connections with the previous notes and new insights developed.  

Types of notes:
- fleeting (stored in my email)
- literature (source notes)
- permanent notes - generally called molecules or atoms in this system

It's important to review fleeting notes as often as possible - within a day if possible. Once they become permanent notes, they should be useful even if you forgot where they came from. If you don't plan on coming back to the note, don’t write it down. That is, only write what is useful to your current line of thinking. Why are you reading this? That question should guide what you write.  

Permanent notes are formed by reading fleeting notes and thinking about what they mean to you and how they fit with the rest of your notes. Permanent notes should be standardIzed in format and kept in one place (i.e. the slipbox). They should be capable of being part of or inspire a unique piece of writing - which should be the end goal of all notes. In my case, the piece of writing could be a trade or thematic write-up. Others could become part of my newsletter. 

My slipbox notes:
- source (like this one)
- atoms (some piece of knowledge which could be in multiple sources)
- molecule (some unique insight - these should be the goal)
- outline (a way of organizing multiple notes)

Multitasking is always a bad idea as it actually makes it harder to accomplish multiple things. This is also true for when you try to store multiple newly learned concepts in your head at once. The slipbox's focus on writing makes it easier to focus on one thing at a time. It should allow you to toggle between extreme focus on one thing and playful exploration/associations between multiple ideas (stored in slipbox) when writing a piece of work. You'll be able to focus on important tasks if less important issues are dealt with - that is, added to your slip box. 

The only unfinished takes that should be left in your short term memory are the most important ones. Your brain will keep thinking about the most important unfinished tasks, and you'll be able to focus on one thing at a time.  

Keywords or hashtags can be used as a way to find a given note, but you should be stingy with the number of such keywords as the connections to other notes are much more important. Hashtags should be picked based on your current interests - i.e. when will you want to see this note? Tags are made from the perspective of a writer not an archivist.

For topics, you can make a new note which gives an outline of the structure of an argument with links to other notes. I'm currently using these for broad topics (e.g. China), and will write narrower onces as topics develop. 


**Writing Process**
Writing is not a linear process - it’s circular and only happens after immersing yourself in your own writing and thoughts. You never actually starting from scratch, and with the slipbox, your problem shouldn’t be finding a topic to write about but rather having too many topics.

Placing facts into writing will be natural as they're easier to remember if they're linked with others. As you combine notes with others, contradictions or implications will become obvious. It will allow you to see fully drawn out lines of reasoning, and writing an outline, and then a manuscript will be the next natural step. This method allows for tighter feedback loops - every time you put a concept in your own writing or link it with other notes, its value for future writing becomes apparent. This should make the process more enjoyable as every note propels the learning further than the last one. 

When writing, if you start with a hypothesis and topic, you're more likely to exclude information that opposes that hypothesis. A better strategy is to write from the bottom up. That is, instead of starting with a topic, start from where your notes tend to cluster. You'll also understand material better this way. Dividing content into disparate topics and modules (like units at school) doesn’t help one understand underlying concepts. Writing content that naturally combines different notes will build a stronger understanding. 

Writing is a means to understanding material even if you don't intend to publish anything. Writing proves to yourself that you understand something in a way that reciting something in your head or explaining to someone else may not. It's easier to fool yourself when  giving an oral explanation as can use non-verbal cues or “know what I mean” which you can’t use in writing. Clear writing require clear thinking. 



  


**Note Taking**
A text on a new topic will require more extensive notes as you’ll need to write more to understand the material. A familiar topic should require fewer notes, as much of it rely on previously written notes. The purpose of notes is to facilitate next step - writing the literature and permanent notes. 

*Strategies*
Notes should hence focus on the structure or theory of the material. Try to abstract from the specific piece and note any models being used. 

Literature notes should focus on the main points and what they mean to you - that is, why are you reading the piece to begin with. Should focus on understanding the material vs completionism and writing everything down. 

We’re more likely to remember facts that confirm what we already think. Hence, it's especially useful to write down notes that conflict with previous thoughts. 

Write what a concept does not mean and compares it to similar or opposite concepts. 

Write to elaborate - take notes and then elaborate on what you read (connect to other pieces, explain what it means to you etc). This allows you to remember and contextualize what you read.

When reading, avoid copying large amounts of text into a note. Instead, read a large amount, attempt to recall it, and then summarize it in your own words. Attempting to recall what you’ve read is the best way to remember something (this is in ultra learning as well).

Read with questions in mind about what you’re reading. Don’t just stay within the writer’s context but focus on the limitations of what you’re reading and how it differs what you know. This is another way of saying read critically.  Think about how it connects with other info and how it may answer other questions beyond what the author presents. In the slip box, these contextual notes should be made and explicitly connected with other notes to form molecules.

For a group of literature notes, the first permanent note could be “why are these notes relevant to my current research?” And “why”

How are these notes connected with others

Are these ideas discussed elsewhere? Why or why not? Check if any of these questions relate to what’s already in slipbox 


Your end goal isn't to remember isolated facts but rather to build connections as there are only so many facts you can remember.





**Four types of cross references (two of them are for physical systems and ignored here**

1) outline notes - as described above - an entry note to a topic with links to other notes. It should also give an overview of a topic. This could be used for trade generations.
2)  Note to note links - this is the most common link

Be as systematic with format and organization as possible. Make templates for different types of notes. There should be one idea per note and they should fit on one screen. Restricting format allows you to focus on content 




**Combing Slipbox for Ideas**


When going through notes, look for paradoxes, similarities, and comparable mental models from different contexts. It works better if permanent notes focus on abstractions and models versus just summaries (these models are currently called molecules). Assemble a toolkit of mental models in a variety of disciplines. You will remember content better if sits on web of these models and if it requires you to compare it to similar or different concepts. Relating concepts from different disciplines requires abstractions and solving creative problems relies on abstracting and finding similar problems or relating them to an event in history.

By looking at clusters of notes you can decide what to write about. Think of follow up questions and then structure these into chapters and finally a manuscript. Decide which notes shouldn’t be in the draft - that is, the problem becomes too much to write about. 

Work on multiple manuscripts at once - when you get stuck on one move to another. That’s the real strength of seeing different notes tied to one another
