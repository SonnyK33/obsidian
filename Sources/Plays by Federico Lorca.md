[[Dangerous Liaisons]]

This book included a trilogy of plays - Blood Wedding, Yerma, and The House of Nernarda Alba. Lorca was a famous poet from the South of Spain who was killed by Franco's forces at the onset of the Spanish Civil War. Some of the themes explored - honour (especially relating to women), blood feuds, and family traditions. Many saw these as allegories for the traditional forces in Spain (including the Church and other fascists).

Why important?
Provided a glimpse of how entrenched traditional values are. Even though Franco wasn't democratically elected, many of his supporters argued he represented the Spanish people and their traditions. Going against tradition (even when you have the numbers to do so) is always difficult. This goes agains the ideals many of us were taught.

**Yerma**
A woman’s desire to have children overtakes everything else. She becomes convinced that her husbands lack of passion for her is why she can’t conceive. Ironically when he shows real passion for her - as a woman, not as a potential mother, she kills him. When he told her that he loves her for herself and that he doesn’t want kids, she strangled him. She saw herself as nothing more than a mother. He claimed to love her for her and nothing more.

**House of Bernarda Alba**
After the family’s father dies, the play centers around the matriarch and her daughters. The mother is domineering and takes pride in daughters virginity. Many of the daughters are pursuing the same man - Pepe- and the play ends with the mother chasing him out and one of the daughters killing herself as she believed he died.
