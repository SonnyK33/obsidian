The main takeaway for me was horrible things happen, and we are often powerless to stop them. They are a function of human psychology and are almost pre-ordained. It is possible to see evil for what it is and recognize right versus wrong, but you may be powerless to choose the righteous path. Even if you think you see things clearly, you'll often go down the wrong path because it's easier and natural. Pilgrim recognized the evils of the Dresden bombing, but stole a diamond from a house he ransacked, married the rich daughter of a local member of the John Birch society, and let his son enlist in Vietnam. 

The aliens (on Trafalmadore) see all things at once, and have no concept of time. They don't believe in cause and effect or even free will. I think this was a metaphor for how we tend to look at history and how we don't take responsibility for our evil actions. The aliens way of thinking seems absurd to us. But we look at history in a very similar way. We don't think about cause and effect but look at isolated episodes and assume they had to occur that way. We look at the past with benefit of knowing the present. Even the central event of the novel - the bombing of Dresden - seems obviously wrong to the reader. But would we have thought the same as it was occcurring? We also forgive ourselves for committing heinous acts by claiming they were necessary. We again forget about cause and effect and make everything inevitable. The colonel in the hospital said the bombing had to happen. Piligrim reminded me of Mersault from Camus' The Stranger, except that he did commit himself at the end. He simply goes with the flow and never protests. The phrase "so it goes" is mentioned whenever someone dies. 

Another theme was the connection between the US' treatment of the poor to its war effort. The American traitor told the Germans that was something that made the US unique - set poor people against one another. The author also compared Dresden with the ghettos in his own city. 

One part that stood out to me was when Pilgrim said the goal of war was to force comformity. He said most people are the "listless playthings of enormous forces". I read this book while reading [[Geopolitical Alpha]] which talked about [[Median Voter Theory]]. It occurred to me that MVT teaches the importance of paying attention to the median voter while war aims to destroy this notion. It destroys the individual.  


**Summary**


I’m reading this novella as I’m interested in anti-war fiction. So far it looks like Billy may have had an episode triggered by the plane crash. It may have reminded him of memories from Dresden he repressed. The writing style is almost lyrical and reminds me of catch 22.

He mentions reading the case of Slovic - an American executed for cowardice. The judgement referred to the importance of making an example of him for daring to disobey authority. I think this has some relevance to the central theme of authority and the punishment for disregarding it. 

His father in law is a member of the John birth society and seems like a reactionary. Billy compared downtown Ilium to Dresden after the firebombing and pointed out where the national guard had deployed tanks - to quell protests and riots I assume? He referenced urban renewal ironically. There are parallels between the fighting in Germany and domestic divisions. This was during 1967 and the Vietnam war was raging. His son is stationed in Vietnam. Billy’s flashbacks are PTSD I’m assuming. He sometimes cries for no reason.

Describes watching a war movie backwards and describes the bombing of a city backwards. The bombs go back into the plane, sent back to the US, materials put back in the ground etc. makes the whole act look merciful or humanitarian ie the opposite of what it was.

The aliens on trafalmadore refer to insects stuck in amber. They’re just there in that moment. There isn’t a reason or explanation for it. Reminds me of Mersault in camus’ the stranger. Not everything has an explanation. The aliens also say that earth is the first place where they heard talk of free will. Did Mersault believe in free will? I think so.  

Pilgrim’s being blamed for the murder of the other solider (weary or something) why? 
What’s the purpose of going back and forth through time. Pilgrim mentioned that the aliens see in 4d - they see all time periods at once. This is probably a device for us to see life in the same way. Events aren’t causing each other. They’re all happening simultaneously. Another example is the bombing in reverse - how it seemed like an altruistic act backwards. Shows that life isn’t linear, events can have many paths. He hasn’t once mentioned what he thinks of the Germans. His son is a green beret in Vietnam - was he drafted? The character doesn’t seem anti-war, he just goes with the flow like Mersault. 

What if we looked at markets and current events this way. We’re definitely of attempting to rationalize everything. Markets aren’t rational, sometimes things just happen. Want to be long - things just happening. Long vol ha.

The novels that the aliens read are just groups of words meant to be read at once. No themes, morals or cause and effect. They’re just interesting and potentially beautiful. Again reminds me of Camus. They’re in a  Nirvana like state - free of cause and effect. Things just are the way they are. 

Pilgrim’s experience in the prison camp with the british soldiers is interesting as it  emphasizes how opulent and luxurious it was. I think this was done just to show the many absurdities of war. Though they were enemies the Germans let the British live well as prisoners as they bribed them with aid given accidentally by the Red Cross. It was revealed that pilgrim committed himself due to witnessing the Dresden fire bombing. The theme of seeing the future and past at the same time continues - as he describes the 40 year old soldier reading to him while he’s on morphine.

Side note - the finale of game of thrones likely alludes to Dresden.

The inevitability of war and human nature seems to be a theme - the Aliens talk about things that have always been and always will be. He sees earthlings as uniquely violent and talks about Americans boiling young German girls alive as well as the atrocities committed against Jews by the nazis. One of his takeaways from the Bible was that you should only execute unimportant ppl. This probably refers to the nameless victims of war. the conversations with the aliens and with his family range from mundane (picking out silver patterns) to the absurd (5 sexes on earth). I’m not sure what is the point of the latter - maybe just the absurdity of life given the horrors of war. He’s treated like a zoo animal by the aliens but doesn’t seem to mind it. He’s happy for the attention for once in his life. He married the unattractive daughter of a hard right conservative presumably for the money. His ring was stolen from someone during the war. His ptsd is probably partially due to guilt over what he’s become since the war.

An interesting passage where he talks about an American who supposedly worked for the German ministry of propaganda and eventually committed Suicide. He wrote a monograph where he explains Americans to Germans. He writes that the US is unique in that it worships the rich and tells poor people they’re responsible for their poverty. It makes poor people hate each other and lets the rich get away with not caring for the poor. It doesn’t say but kind of implies that this dynamic allows the country to build an army and engage in war. It’s also interesting as his father in law is a wealthy reactionary. He earlier compared the projects in his home town to war zones. His critique on war extends to social commentary on the exploitation of the poor. One requires the other.

The character Lazaro who’s obsessed with revenge relays a story where he killed a dog by feeding it steak laced with sharp metal. This is prob to foreshadow the sacking of Dresden. Even the way he describes revenge - the sweetest is thing in the world. 

The author makes sure to point out when the POWs were moved to Dresden that they had nothing to worry about as the city wasn’t a target. It did not have major industries.

Pilgrims in a plane crash and his father in law dies. He saw this coming. What’s the relevance ? Everything is ordained? 

I’m not sure what the point of kilgert trout the science fiction author is. The theme of things beyond our control and instead in the hands of the powerful continues. When Derby confronts the nazi Campbell, Pilgrim says most people are “listless playthings of enormous forces”. Says war stops people from becoming characters that are individuals. War forces comformity and disregards free will. The aliens said everything that will be is already and is visible to them. This is due to the inevitability of life and possibly caused by things like war.

Author uses Campbell the American turned nazi to critique American policy before and after the war. He tells the American POWs that they’ll have to fight the communists sooner or later anyways and likens nazi ideology to settler colonialism in America. He says that Americans and nazi should work together against communists and reveals the US’ true intentions. This goes against common notion that USA was against nazism   

Derby is the good guy who confronts Campbell despite the war which tends to wear down your individuality and desire to speak up. It occurs to me that we read and analyze history the way the aliens watch the present. The aliens talk about how there's no concept of time; they just see things as they've been and always will be. We view history in the same way, as inevitable, and with the complete benefit of hindsight. We see the past, knowing the present, and knowing what happened immediately afterwards. It's in that prism that we view history. For instance, we read about stagflation in the 1970s. But that's only a concept in hindsight. At the time, it wasn't clear what was going on. In the book, we view the sacking of dresden negatively. But maybe that's only because we view it, knowing how bad it ended up being. While the allies were bombing the city, the perspective was different. It seems odd to us to forget about the concept of time, as the aliens do. But we do that all the time when viewing history.

The ring he uses to propose was stolen from Germany. The four guards reminded him of a barbershop quartet. When a group sang to him for his birthday they reminded him of those 4 
guards.

Given the destruction at Dresden it was clear that there weren’t supposed to be any survivors. 
Everyone knows how destructive the nuclear attacks on Japan were, but incredible destruction was done by conventional weapons as well - notably Dresden 

His wife died of carbon monoxide poisoning as a result of her car getting mangled in an accident. This happened when she was coming to visit him in the hospital. Not sure what the point of this was. Unnecessary death? She survived the accident but not the aftermath ? 
The military officer in the hospital defends the bombing of Dresden as necessary. He sees pilgrim as weak and wishes he was dead.

Pilgrim references the aliens when he agrees that the allied attack on Dresden was necessary. 
Strong themes of free will vs human nature. During Nuremberg, many officers said they were forced. He travels to NY as he wants to tell the world his story. If you believe the aliens, there is no free will. His wife dies and he doesn’t really respond. If death doesn’t matter, and time is not real, why be bothered by her death. 

I’m not sure what the point of the trip to NY and the episode in the pornography shop was. The story ends with the haunting image of billy and other POWs looking for bodies in Dresden. The stench was so bad they used flamethrowers to incinerate them rather than retrieve them.
