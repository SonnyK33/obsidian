Written by a western correspondent, first from the guardian and then NYtimes, depicts Pakistan as a country of contradictions - a small westernized elite in a Islamic country - where alcohol is officially banned but enjoyed by many. Post partition, Pakistan was looking like a success - in the 1960s, it’s economy was on par with Singapore. It was westernized compared to socialist India. But then it made the mistake of warring with India over Kashmir. The war with east Pakistan which led to it losing 1/3 of its territory was its biggest mistake. It continues to have border disputes with India and Afghanistan. Internal strife is also common with different ethnic and tribal groups. Much like India, it suffers from many “original sins” dating back to artificial borders created by the British. Elite  Pakistanis resent being put in the same category as the fundamentalists but are also angered when their Muslim identity is attacked. What struck me about this book were the similarities between Pakistan and India. Not the culture or the people, but the issues stemming from partition that they continue to deal with. Both states were artificial constructs when the British drew the border. Both states grapple with extreme income inequality which hampers democracy. The story of how Jinnah kept his house in Mumbai because he thought he could go back periodically was another remarkable detail. I continue to wonder what the true origins of the partition violence were. Jinnah was also portrayed in a more sympathetic light from what I'm used to in Indian sources. 

Pakistan post partition sidelined the mullahas. They got their revenge when general Zia came to power. He came from a religious working class family and looked down on the whisky drinking aristocratic British trained soldiers and politicians. He also uses Islam to appeal to the masses and legitimize his own rule.

**Red mosque siege**

Students from the red mosque attacked Chinese women working at a nearby massage parlor; When the Chinese government protested, Musharraf ordered the military to infiltrate the mosque and arrest the leaders. The siege angered many Pakistanis as Musharaf was seen to be attacking pious mullas to appease foreigners 

**Jinnah**

Jinnah like Nehru was an English gentleman - from a wealthy family and educated in Britain. He wasn’t religious and went back and forth regarding the importance of an independent Pakistan. At times he only wanted autonomy for Muslim states, and some say that idea of Pakistan was just a ploy for more concessions from the Hindu-dominated Congress party. Most of Pakistan’s borders were contested and a majority couldn’t speak Urdu. Muslims had been discriminated against by the British raj - revenge for an earlier mutiny - and were sidelined from civil service. They feared these inequities would be made permanent in India. 

The name Pakistan came  from a Cambridge student who pitched it to Jinnah while he was at a party in London - from its constituent  parts - Punjab, Afghani, Kashmir and Sindh and Stan from Balochistan. Jinnah himself married a Parsi woman and criticized Gandhi for bringing Hinduism into the struggle for freedom - congress was supposed to be secular but had many Hindu references.

Mountbatten (the last Viceroy to India from England) was in an open marriage and it was rumored that his wife had an affair with Nehru. This angered Muslims who felt that Nehru used this relationship to his advantage.

Jinnah and Nehru were not ready for the carnage that occurred during partition - Jinnah even kept his mansion in Bombay - and assumed he’d be able to visit (even spend his winters there) post partition.   

Jinnah kept his house in Mumbai assuming he could return on weekends (there’s now an ownership dispute between the Pakistani state and jinnahs descendants, and BJP members want to tear it down - the land is worth $400m. Jinnah was allowed to keep the house as a favour from Nehru - most property like this was labeled abandoned and given to Hindu refugees from Pakistan. Immediately after partition, relations bw Pakistan and India were warm - Nehru travelled to Karachi in the 1950s and was cheered by crowds. This changed after the first war over Kashmir in the 1960s.

**Pashtuns**

Pashtuns are the dominant tribe of Afghanistan and have resisted conquests from the Russians, British, and Sikhs. They formed a state in the 18th century which later fell apart. Their historic homeland was split up by the Durand land and they’ve never accepted the border (while Pakistan has).

Pashtuns are guided by ancient traditions and loyalties that may supersede Islam (particularly orthodox sharia). While partially a caricature, many cling to blood feuds and handle justice locally rather than relying on the state. While they were sympathetic toward the taliban in Afghanistan post the 2001 invasion, and saw their resistance as legitimate, most did not support the radicals that formed the Pakistani taliban in waziristan and the NW. when the CIA bombed the tora bora mountains, many fled across the border to Pakistan. Many groups had received support from the ISI who kept them as a proxy to fight with in Kashmir and other places.

These groups spread radical Islam (along w money from Saudi Arabia) in rural and poor parts of NW Pakistan where the state was already subordinate to local jirgas/tribes. As they engaged in terrorism against the local population - some due to radical teachings, but also due to general lawlessness and the opportunity to earn ransom money - the local Pashtuns responded in kind.

**Role of Military**
The military plays an important role in Pakistani politics and has since Zia took over in a coup. They enjoy the support of wealthy Pakistanis and have vast business interests. Deep income inequality and the power of land owning feudal lords contributes to the anti-democratic nature of the military. Bhutto the elder was not loved by the rich partially because he was in favour of land reform. A lot of unanswered questions remain regarding benazir’s death as well as the osama raid - how complicit was the Pakistani military? Bhutto the daughter proposed giving international weapons inspectors access to the father of Pakistans nuclear weapons program shortly before she was killed.

**Balochistan**
Balochistan - one of Pakistan’s provinces - is the largest in size but accounts for a small percentage of hr population. Like the Pashtuns, they’ve never been fully integrated into the state, and there’s an active insurgency there fighting for independence. When partition happened, many opposed the new state. It lies between Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iran, and is a major drug smuggling route. The state is run by powerful sardaars who form a de facto state.There remains a small Hindu and Sikh minority in parts of Balochistan. The Indian government covertly supports independence movements in balochistan.

**Waziristan**
Waziristan is still ruled under draconian colonial era rules and is treated as an ungovernable tribal area. Pakistan used it and connections with the taliban to maintain a foothold in Afghanistan. This started during the Cold War when Pakistan was used by the US to channel weapons to jihadis. Pakistan knew the US wouldn’t stay forever and didn’t want India to be able to establish a presence there. After it saw success in fighting against the Russian occupation, it replicated similar actions in Kashmir. The ISI became much more potent (and poisonous to Pakistani democracy) after its role in aiding the mjahadeen against the soviets. 


**India**  
Modis rise to power has vindicated Jinnahs claims that the Muslim minority needed its own state. And India is moving away from the pluralist tradition of Nehru - much like Pakistan moved away from Jinnahs secular vision. The two states have much in common. Most importantly they’re modern states which papered over distinct communities and ethnic groups who were never under the control of a central government.
