Mental Models - (move to molecules?)
1) How is money created in the modern economy - [[Monetary Tightening - 2022]]
2) Central banks conduct monetary policy primarily through the banking sector - they directly or indirectly control short-term repo rates (a type of unsecured money market) which is a key funding mechanism for the banks. However, banks will only lend if they can find profitable projects and if they have adequate capital. Central banks can only make it easier for banks to lend - they can't actually make them lend. The ECB's negative rates show the extent to which monetary authorities can push banks to lend - in effect penalizing them for holding reserves. However, a slowing economy (e.g. due to an ageing population or rigid labour rules) may not incentivize bank lending even with negative rates on reserves. 


Summary - 

Central Banking 101 provides an overview of how the US Federal System functions under the hood. It's focused on the US Fed, but most of the concepts could be applied to foreign central banks as well. By mandate, the role of the Fed is to maintain full employment and to keep inflation at 2%. It operates by influencing money creation, either directly by purchasing treasuries in exchange for banking reserves or by making it cheaper for banks to create new money by lending. The way the Fed intervenes in the US economy has changed since the GFC. It used to directly control the amount of reserves in the banking system which allowed it to control the amount of bank lending. Due to the excess reserves created at the onset of the GFC, it now drives change by adjusting the rate it pays on reserves. 

Through the rate paid on reserves, along with the reverse repo facility, it can affect short-term unsecured money market rates which in turn affects spreads that banks earn on their loans. They can affect longer term rates by directly purchasing treasuries from banks or corporates thus driving those yields lower as well (known as QE).  The era of QE, along with near zero rates, is coming to an end. No one really knows what will happen as the Fed's balance sheet shrinks and the excess reserves are drained from the system.

Due to the US dollar's status as the de facto global reserve currency, the actions of the Fed have an outsized impact on the rest of the world. Dollars outside the US (Eurodollars) also play a central role in global finance. The rates on eurodollars  can signal excess foreign demand for dollars and hence stress in the system.

1) How do central bank operations differ between the Fed, ECB, BOE, BOJ, BOC, and most EM banks? What are the implications?
6) Look at MMT -  gets monetary system right but may give too much credit to government officials who need some constraints a on spending.
7) Why the break down in phillips curve?  Low labour force participation rate? Low interest rates led to more job growth but not spending?

Book Notes - 
**1) Types of Money**
[[Types of Money]]



**2) The Money Creators**
See [[Money Creation]]

Money is created by commercial banks, the Fed, and the Treasury.
*Banks*
In the 19th century prior to a unified currency, banks printed their own banknotes - which typically sold at a discount given risk that bank could go insolvent due to bad loans. Today deposits are risk free due to FDIC insurance 

Banks are contrained by liquidity and solvency. Liquidity needs are met by reserves on hand or are borrowed from other banks or the Fed's discount window. Solvency needs are met with capital, i.e. to absorb a given amount of defaulted loans.

*Central Banks* 
Central banks can decrease long term yields by purchasing long dated treasuries from corporates or banks. They pay for treasuries by creating reserves. If they buy assets from non-banks the seller’s bank is given the reserves and they’re given a deposit.

Central bank digital currencies - could obviate need for interbank payments and allow individuals to hold accounts at the fed but would give govt total control over interest rates and your money.


*Treasury*
Treasuries are only backed by faith in the US govt. Reserves are backed by the assets they purchased (treasuries, fiat, or bank deposits).

The treasury’s funding goals are based on funding the deficit as cheaply as possible and picks where along the curve to issue.

For sudden needs in funding (eg the cares act in 2020), the treasury will issue at the shorter end of the curve.




**3) Shadow Banks**

Away from commercial banks are various entities that provide funding and leverage but are not regulated like banks.

The fed only directly deals with primary dealers, but can interact with “shadow banks” including dealers through the primary dealers. Shadow banks may borrow from primary dealers who in turn can borrow from the fed - as they did during the Covid crisis in 2020 when investment funds wanted to sell or mortgage assets they had for cash, dealers borrowed from the Fed to finance purchases.

*Money market funds* 

There are 2 types - govt which invest in govt securities and prime which invest in govt and foreign bank securities. Foreign banks don’t usually have a large retail deposit base and so rely on money markets for funding. Investors treat prime MMFs as bank deposits but they aren’t guaranteed and the “buck broke” when Lehman failed. This caused fears in other MMFs and more investors pulled their money causing fire sale valuations and further outflows. They were eventually bailed out by an FDIC like facility setup by the treasury 

*ETFs*
ETFs can also act like shadow banks as they hold assets which aren’t necessary liquid but issue shares which are. Redeeming an ETF shouldn’t cause a liquidity issue as a basket of securities should be given in return. However if an investor is arbing a discrepancy by selling the underlying that could cause more selling pressure when there aren’t any buyers (like during March 2020)

*Mortgage REITs*
Mortgage reits borrow in overnight market to lend in long-term mortgage instruments. They use extensive leverage to make up for small spreads.

**4) Eurodollar Market**

As 50pct of trade is in USD, there is a large market for dollars outside of the US. For historical reasons, these are called eurodollars. 

The offshore dollar market is $10tr vs $30tr total dollar market. While its main original use was to get away from US regulations (including reserve requirements), that mostly ended in the financial crisis. Now it’s mainly to serve offshore institutions (eg non bank corporates w dollar needs) and is mostly run by global banks (not American). Because they don’t have retail deposits they have to rely on money markets and FX swaps. This makes them more vulnerable to bank runs, for example they had to borrow $500bn in fx swaps during Covid crisis.

Money can be created by foreign banks in a similar fashion as domestic banks. If the foreign bank has an account at the fed, the process is identical. If it doesn’t, it’ll have to keep deposits at a domestic US bank. If a customer wants a loan and spends the proceeds on supplies, the foreign bank will settle the transfer by having its bank send reserves to the suppliers bank.  

This shows how reserve ratios don’t constrain money supply. The foreign bank’s bank has to stick to a certain reserve ratio. For example against $10 in reserves it may have $100 deposits. But if $10 of those deposits went to the foreign bank, the latter could in turn lend out a multiple of that $10. And the foreign bank isn’t bound by reserve ratios. It also shows how the true constraint of money supply is bank profitability. That is, there must be profitable loans in order for banks to expand money supply. The shape of the yield curve (in particular 3m treasuries vs 10 year) is a good indicator for NIMs and bank profitability.   

Post GFC, Basel III incentivized banks to rely more on retail deposits (more sticky) and less on other bank deposits or money markets which move first And themselves could be vulnerable to bank runs. Institutional investors then moved their excess cash to foreign banks. The offshore dollar bond market is linked to the offshore banking market since the dollar proceeds are deposited into foreign banks. Since all offshore interbank transactions still need to be settled via the fed, the US exerts control over the global dollar banking sector. 

Offshore banks may not have access to fed discount window. If there’s a run on those banks, they’ll go to the money markets and bid up dollars which can be destabilizing. The fed provided funding to foreign central banks via swap lines which in turn provided funding to domestic banks during crises - 2008 and 2020.


**5) Interest Rates**
RRP - [[Reverse Repo Facility]]
The Fed controls the short end of the rate curve through the fed funds rate which is the rate at which banks can borrow reserves on an unsecured basis. Before the GFC, they Fed set this rate by manipulating the amount of reserves in the banking sector such that the rate paid by banks fell into the set range. During the crisis though, reserves went from $20bn to a few trillion and so it couldn’t control the rate through the quantity of reserves. At the time the focus was more to dramatically increase the level of lending. Post crisis, it controls the fed rate by 1) the reverse repo rate (RRP) which is the rate they pay for overnight lending and 2) the interest they pay on reserves. 

The RRP is the rate at which banks (as well as money market funds and other participants) can lend to the fed risk free. They’ll only lend to the private sector above this level so it sets a floor on the overnight rate.  

The interest on reserves is what the banks get for keeping reserves at the fed. This acts as a ceiling (I think) on the fed funds rate as banks can borrow at the FF rate and still earn at the IoR rate.  The RRP is more influential today than the FF rate as it can be accessed by many market participants but only banks borrow at FF. New regulations have also discouraged use of FF rate.

Longer term rates  are a function of expectations of future Fed actions and a term premium 
Eg 10 year rate is the same as the overnight rate for 10 yrs plus a term premium 
  
Future rates can be implied by Eurodollar futures which are a prediction of future LIBOR rates.
These are the best approximations of future fed fund rates but are still a little different and have a credit component (are higher in times of distress - as foreign banks will compete for dollars - see eurodollar market example above). Can use these rates as well as observed treasury rates to get an implied term premium. Term premium has gone down as low inflation vol allows for better forecasts which decreases need for higher rates to justify locking in rates. The flight to quality in times of stress has also lowered term premia. 

Rates are also just a function of supply and demand fore treasuries which is hard to forecast. Supply is based on deficits but also where along the curve the treasury decides to issue or even if it decides to issue something new (like 20 years). Demand based on desires of various actors incl foreign central banks, their trade practices as well as regulatory issues (eg banks or pension fund holdings).

**6) Money Markets**

Post GFC these are dominated by secured money market funds (banks are discouraged from borrowing in unsecured market). The most important part of secured MM is the repo market which is overnight secured lending. A security is sold to a dealer at a Discount to market price (the safer the collateral, the smaller the discount or haircut) with the promise to repurchase it the next day for a slightly higher price. This gives the lender a better position if the borrower goes bankrupt since the security was already sold. This gives liquidity to the lender and also allows for cheap leverage (only putting down the haircut to purchase a security). We obviously use this to get leverage on our positions.

Fed Repos - [[Central Bank Operations]]


FX swaps are the other major money market - a few trillion trade each day. Allow an investor to borrow in FX by using local currency as collateral. Technically they’re borrowing spot and repaying in a forward contract. If engaging in a US-EUR fx swap, the dollar borrower pays libor and earns euribor. Can be used by foreign central banks to earn a return on extra reserves, hedge (banks hedging FX loans or investors headging FX risk when investing in foreign assets). 

There was a jump in demand for dollars during Covid and GFC - led to a jump in the basis - the extra amount of interest you have to pay (eg over LIBOR) If there’s excess demand for that currency (eg the USD). The basis hence serves as a good indicator for demand of that currency. Because of the basis, USD investors may have gotten a better return in negative yielding eurozone treasuries on a hedged basis (there’s so much demand for their dollars that they earn more than LIBOR by lending it out - that’s the basis- and they pay a negative rate for borrowed Euros - that is, they earn interest. These make up for the negative yield on the European treasury.

Unsecured money markets have gotten much smaller post GFC, as Basel 3 discourages interbank lending on an unsecured basis. CDs are the biggest instrument and mostly allow foreign banks to access a reliable source of funding as they don’t have a depositor base. CP is the next biggest and can be issued by anyone as they’re not deposits. 

The fed funds market is another unsecured money market instrument was important pre-GFC as it allowed banks to borrow reserves from one another on an unsecured basis. They needed reserves to meet end of of day requirements. Banks don’t need to borrow here anymore due to QE and the excess of reserves (will this change with QT?). The fed funds rate used to constantly fluctuate but is now a step function. The rate has also gotten less important as regulations discourage unsecured overnight lending between banks. The only real use now is for GSEs who have a fed account but can’t earn interest on reserves. They can lend their reserves to foreign banks who can then deposit at the fed and earn interest on reserves. 
 
Money market reform law of 2016 killed the unsecured MM as it gave funds the right to freeze withdrawals in times of stress. This worried investors who pulled their money. The banks which relied on this funding moved to the govt repo market (ie secured).

As the fed funds rate is close to obsolete, fed may move to another rate like SOFR


**7) Capital Markets**

When banks issue done/equity securities that causes a net reduction in money as bank deposits are used to purchase them. When corporate bonds or equities are purchased, bank deposits transfer to the seller. In theory they’re transferred to someone who can use them more efficiently.

Agency MBS - guaranteed by Ginnie Mae (risk free) or Freddie/Fannie (close to risk free). 

Treasury auctions can be monitored to gauge demand for new treasuries. Watch for yields on new issues vs expectation and the amount of demand (amount of bids - high bid to cover). A low share of purchases by primary dealers (who are obligated to buy) means more demand from investors.


**8) Crisis Monetary Policy**

The spread between LIBOR and OIS rates can indicate stress in the Eurodollar market. High LIBOR means overseas banks are willing to pay well above fed funds for access to dollars. they may need access to dollars because they’re facing redemptions or losses on dollar investments and don’t have a depositor base. When rates hit zero, they started relying on forward guidance and QE to affect longer term rates. 

Forward guidance tended to raise market volatility around economic releases as it linked them to specific fed actions

Yield curve control - when a central bank sets a target for a specific tenor eg. The BOJ set a 0pct target for the ten year. YCC typically requires fewer purchases as the mere target pushes the rate there since the market knows the bank’s goal.   

Negative rates hurt banking sector profitability and explain poor stock performance of European banks and may explain poor overall growth. It’s clear that low rates help financial assets but not necessarily Econ growth.

**9) How to Fed Watch**

In addition to FOMC statement and dot plot, should look at fed balance sheet, to see which facilities are being used and changes in FX swap facilities, and desks surveys to see what questions the fed is asking.

Blogs at the Fed are good for educating on the latest - NY fed liberty street and fed board of governors FEDS notes. 

Powell recently changed the Fed framework - no longer raise rates just because employment is over the theoretical max - since they can’t forecast this max and the relationship bw inflation and unemployment has broken down. 2019 had historically low unemployment but still low inflation.

Will also target average inflation so that undershooting is followed by overshooting.
