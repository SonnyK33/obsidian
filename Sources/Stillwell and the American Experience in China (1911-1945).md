Summary
- Stillwell as the American military liasison officer to CKS
- He spoke Chinese and was well acquainted with Chinese customs and culture
- He saw CKS as corrupt and incompetent and believed he was more interested in defeating the Communists than the Japanese
	- argued that CKS was using lend lease to hoard materiel for the future fight with the communists
- Provides a counter-argument to the standard "how did the USA lose China?" line of reasoning:
	- plenty of aid was given, in fact, too much was given to CKS
- the US government never took the time to assess how popular CKS actually was with the Chinese people
	- It likely didn't care either; more important was the fact that CKS was an ally against Communism and would look after US interests there
	- his ties to the missionary community also helped
- provides interesting commentary on how US and UK policies differed - the UK didn't want to empower CKS as it valued its empire in SE Asia (Singapore, HK) and especially nearby India
- Roosevelt's mother's family made its fortune in China, and he was sympathetic to it
- Puts the Taiwan issue in context - US support for Taiwan has nothing to do with democracy (it didn't become democratic for 50 years, and CKS never sought to be representative of the average Chinese peasant) and everything to do with its anger over losing China to the Communists 
- CKS (and the US by proxy) lost China despite all of the aid and arms given throughout WW2 as part of lend lease
- while the Soviet Union did support Mao ideologically, its support was nowhere near that of the US towards CKS (and Stalin was a WW2 ally of the US and CKS)
- US support for CKS was due to his connections with the Soong family and the simple fact that he was the first leader after the tumultuous warlord era
	- The US continued to support Japan throughout the 1930s (even through the infamous rape of Nangking) and considered trade with Japan more important that China's sovereignty
	- Japan was similarly seen as an ally against communism 
- The final split between Stillwell and CKS was driven by the former's desire to integrate the Communists into the fight against Japan




Tuchman gives an account of US general Joseph [[Stillwell]]’s efforts in [[China]] from post-WW1 through the defeat of Japan in WW2. Stillwell was a sinophile who grew to love China, its language, and its people starting as a language officer after WW1. He was the US’ main military liaison to [[Chang Kai-Shek]] and the head of various military commands in China during its war with Japan. He was constantly at odds with CKS as he didn’t respect his competence and didn’t think he had the respect or will of the people on his side. He wanted to help China defeat Japan and thought American money and materiel should be directed to that usage. He believed that CKS was more interested in hoarding aid and defeating his main rival - the communists.

Much of the China discourse today focuses on how the US “lost” China during this period and how the US must protect [[Taiwan]] from China. This book explains how the US lost China - by backing an illegitimate and unrepresentative leader, and by not understanding the appeal of the communists to the peasant masses. It also puts the Taiwan conflict into context - Taiwan is not just a country that China wants to take over; rather it is the legacy of US interference in the Chinese civil war. The US-backed CKS who lost to the communists despite incredible US aid, fled to Taiwan. The US navy quickly entered the region and forbade Mao from retaking Taiwan (which was previously colonized by first the Dutch and then the Japanese).
