Follow-ups:
Similar framework for predicting capital allocation for other credits:

	- EM governments (read Geopolitical Alpha)

**Oil**

-   drilling hasn't increased depsite higher prices
-   US rig count is 530 (as of Nov-22) - 40% below 2018 levels despite 2x oil prices
-   DUC inventories have been exhausted, and so have to either increase drilling or accept lower production
-   IRRs for new shale wells are high:

	-   high quality permian acreage can generate 40m in undiscounted CF at $80 WTI, vs $8m in drilling and completion costs
	-   given >50% of well's CF generated in first 2 years, IRRs are high - over 200%

-   drilling hasn't increased for 3 reasons:
	-   anti-drilling policymakers in US, Canada, and Europe
		-   execs worry that higher prices will be met with calls for higher taxes
		-   all policies have been either been hostile (export bans, windfall taxes) or neutral for EPs (reducting gasoline taxes)

-   valuations
	-   as most E&Ps are trading at a discount to PV-10 NAVs, you don't get the price appreication you'd expect from increasing production
	-   get more bang from your buck by buying back shares
	-   seeing some disperison - those trading at a premium to NAV are increasing production, opposite for those at a discount who are buying back stock instead
	-   in 2018, even though oil prices were lower, industry traded >3x NAV, and so it made sense to pay for production

-   lack of tier-1 Permian assets
	-   there's been a depletion of tier 1 shale properties
	-   if they drilled at 2018 levels (100 wells a month - would be a 2x increase), would fully develop acreage in 4 years
	-   makes sense to wait until trading at a premium to NAV
	-   at current rates of production, tier 1 properties could be drilled by 2030 

-   inventory/production numbers:
	-   global demand is ~102 mm bbl/day
	-   OPEC supply is 29.9 and non-OPEC is 71 (including OPEC NGLs)
	-   leaving 400mm excess demand in Q4 which is normally made up by excess pumping capacity
	-   this capacity may not be there - 
		-   currently pumping 2mm below quotas 
		-   Saudi's drilling 11mm bbl/day (>10.5 isn't sustainable)
		-   Iranian production not coming back (esp as allied w/ Russia/China)
		-   total pumping capacity is 31 mm b/d (not accepted 34m)

-   inventories falling to 2007 levels when oil spiked to $145

**Natural Gas**

-   US and international NG prices may converge in 2023
-   higher export capacity and more global demand
-   return of Freeport LNG export facility (after a fire)
-   low storage levels
-   production plateuing at Marcellus and Haynesville (not sure why this leads to convergence?)
-   prices will have to rise

**Gold/Silver**

-   corrective phase may be ending
-   watch for commercial traders' positioning to get positive (has gotten less negative) and for speculators' positioning to get negative (has been going down)
-   when they cross, that's usually a buy signal
-   buy signal is there for silver currently, and gold normally follows ~6m
-   central banks also shifting to buyers (China may have been undisclosed buyer in Q3; Turkey/Qatar/Uzbekistan/India have been buyers)
-   China fits with theme of them selling treasuries and wanting to move from dollar
 

**Agriculture**
-   food nationalism likely a real trend
-   India banning wheat and some rice exports (accounts for 40% of global rice exports)

  **Uranium**
-   switching from a surplus to a global deficit
-   many countries building new plants - Poland, Netherlands
-   France streamlined policies; has annoucned plans to build 14 new new reactors in coming years
-   India to triple electrciity from nucleal power by 2030 (currently has 7 and has plans to build 10 new ones in 3years)

**Copper**  

-   China warehouses have been depleted
-   supply hasn't kept up with demand (Codelco has cited declining ore grades)
-   India a big story going forward -> demand up 45% this year 
-   Chinese Cu market the tightest it's been in a decade
