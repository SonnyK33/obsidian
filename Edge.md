- fundamentals - focus on the variance around estimates rather than their mean
	- hard to just do a better job at predicting a company's EBITDA esp given how much coverage liquid credits have
	- instead I try to determine how risky those estimates are
		- what is the range for sales, costs, etc
		- what is the range for EBITDA, a FCF and where should things trade in the extremes of that range
		- based on that, is there asymmetry?
	- it doesn't matter what next year's EBITDA is, that's unknowable - what matters is the degree to which it can be estimated and the range of possible outcomes
		- that's how you price risk and look for trading opportunities 
- by being a generalist, have a better sense of how to price risk
	- risk-free vs IG vs HY
	- DM vs EM 
	- high beta vs low beta credits
