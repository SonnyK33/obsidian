8am/Opening thoughts
Stocks are down after a huge run up (one of the biggest easings this year) and rates sold off. I should have bought more puts over the last few days; I didn't because I felt stupid for chasing them a couple of weeks ago and over-paying. Classic mistake with consequences beyond just that one trade. At least I resisted and didn't buy more rates when they were surging. I should buy some today.
