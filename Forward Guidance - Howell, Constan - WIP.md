Takeaways:
- A weaker real economy may free up working capital and give more liquidity to financial markets (i.e. unwinding inventories release cash back to banks which gets recycled) - very counter-intuitive
- The Drunkenmiller indicator - cyclical stock performance vs defensive 




Liquidity bottomed in Oct 22. Since then it’s risen from the PBOC, a weaker dollar, and lower bond volatility which makes it easier to repo. The lack of TGA issuance and the RRP have offset QT. The Fed is more concerned with the functioning of the treasury market than rates. They need to cut rate vol and may eventually move to YCC like Japan. There are $3tr of bank reserves and the Fed says the min is 1.5. Some academics say it should be 2.5 or there could be issues with refinancing. The TGA will be more volatile because of debt ceiling issues and tax season. There's a chance that the TGA goes below a minimum threshold which is why bank reserves are being kept constant. 

A lot of PBOC liquidity is coming in, more than twice previous years. This will boost commodities. He likes crypto because it tracks the easing of liquidity. Liquidity tracks an average of gold and crypto. Liquidity drives financial markets which drives the real economy. He likens this year to post-tech bubble, to 2002, except that Chinese liquidity is completely different now vs then. In 2002, we had impact of 911 and no China easing. The big drivers now are lower bond volatility, higher commodity prices, and Chinese liquidity. 

Fed wants to reduce its balance sheet but keep reserves flat. That requires winding down the RRP. 
They can adjust rates on that to make it less attractive. The Fed is paying more on RRP than earning on treasuries and MBS. That loss is liquidity for the system. The treasury has said TGA could go sub-100 but would like it to be 700. It’s 500 now so there’s a lot of volatility in the short term. The $2tr RRP is a bigger factor.  

Yield curve inversion does predict recessions but different pairs work better for different recessions. Have to take into account convexity. Right now the negative term premia matters because the curve is more inverted because of negative term premia in the 10yr. That’s caused by a shortage of collateral. Inversion tells you more about financial than economic fragility.  

Doesn’t think they’ll cut this year. The Fed is maintaining financial stability with the balance sheet and fighting inflation with rates. The Fed will cut eventually as inflation comes down but term premia will be rising due to less foreign demand. Japan is more focused on buying its own bonds. 
China and Saudi are buying fewer treasuries. And the rates market will range trade and hence so will equities.   

Historically strong flows into the US and EU were caused by a lack of good collateral. Basel III required banks to hold more and QE took most of it out of circulation especially in Europe. There's 
$60tr global debt due every year. Given higher rates and all the debt due for refi, debt to GDP will rise. This will require more liquidity. GDP will be growing at a slower pace, so liquidity to GDP is rising which means higher multiples. The fed will do YCC because they can’t pay higher rates.

So don’t buy treasuries, but buy stocks and commodities and crypto. He thinks a soft landing is the most likely. The business cycle still has to turn so could be short term noise. Likes China because of the liquidity. 

**Adding next 2 podcasts with Howell and Andy Constan**


There may be more liquidity for the financial sector when the real economy is not doing well. For example, when inventories are winding down, that releases cash that gets deposited in banks and recycled. 

Howell measures fed liquidity as:

BS - RRP- TGA- loss/gains on portfolio

The last component is whether Fed paying out more than earning. Liquidity was flat in Oct as measured by bank reserves, but it increased after the SVB crisis. Now they can say they're doing QT even as liquidity goes up. They're doing YCC by issuing more bills and buying back long dated. They're also issuing bills to target MMF who can withdraw from RRP. This is hence absorbing the issuance and is not cutting liquidity. It also means more collateral, as bill issuance correlates with risk on.  

After bailing out the market, the next step is government spending, as mandatory expenses are increasing. Technology will make offshoring easier especially with AI, which will decrease the tax base. Foreign countries will be buying fewer treasuries in the future.   

There have been several avenues for higher liquidity:

Bond volatility move index lower
Debt ceiling
Reserves to MM which may trickle into equities
Operating losses

The Move index is more important than the VIX for equity investors, as bond volatility is a measure of repo and the availability of collateral.  

If we went back to the Cold War levels of defense spending (5pct of GDP), the US would be issuing $2tr a year which the Fed will have to monetize, and QE will have to  come back. Foreigners will buy less treasuries and households will demand higher yields which will push the deficit higher.   

Falling inflation and inflation persistence (11m vs 50m in the 1980s) has led to the market re-rating. PMI's are falling, but inflation is falling further. China will have to stimulate, and more capital flows are going into Asia including Japan. **A weaker real economy may free up working capital and give more liquidity to financial markets.** 

Term premia will become less negative with more issuance, even if rates go down. This means you should be weary of long-term bonds. The Drunkenmiller indicator - cyclical stock performance vs defensive stocks. 

A lot of funds have gone to EM, and China needs to goose its economy. EM has done well in face of dollar strength indicating the economy is not weak.

  

BOJ wasn’t as accommodating last year as some argue if you look at liquidity creating part of actions and incorporate sterilization

  

Rates stay at current levels

Can’t go down as need to deter more debt

Can’t go up bc risks fiscal sustainability given rising defense spending and others 

  

Liquidity tight but is rising which is what matters

Housing and semis going well which are leading

Central banks will supply liquidity or there will be financial crises

  

Constan - standard measures of liquidity use levels and not returns as they should. They’re correlated but not cointegrated.

  

Howell - central banks used to play a much smaller role in the economy. Can’t just pay attention to bank reserves because it matters how funds go from central banks to money markets and reserves.

Constan - markets done well since last year due to high nominal gdp growth and fiscal spending 

  

Post debt ceiling, they issued bills rather than duration which is neutral to liquidity

Given inverted curve, this is more expensive and may have been done bc didn’t want to compete with banks who were also selling duration 

  

It makes sense to issue bills to drain the RRP as the latter has become a more expensive form of funding 

  

Shorter term is also more stimulating as the rate is higher - YCC?

Also looking at buybacks which could be funded with bills

Key thing is Janet is in control and has shown a willingness to manipulate the term structure regardless of the Feds qt

Yellens way of creating liquidity - can’t create reserves like the fed

Likely to accelerate going into the election 

  

Lack of collateral has driven inversion not an impending recession

Fiscal spending is stimulating 

Inverted yield curve good for corporate sector bc they have cash invested at front end and are borrowing at back end 

  

Negative term premia could revert at some point esp with more issuance and foreign buyers won’t step in like they used to 

  

Howell - expect inflation to be volatile in coming decades with steady but rising liquidity

Makes inflation important to watch 

  

Andy likes long stocks plus bonds as if rates fall stocks had to have fallen as well

Key thing to watch is when will treasury issue bonds vs bills and term premia

Current depressed long term yields are good for stocks esp bc many are net cash or have locked in yields

Andy - short twos and spoos bc for stocks to stay high yields would have to have risen as well 

  

BRICS gold holdings could be challenge to usd

**Trades**
Equities - likes commodities and EM (China) and cyclicals though that’s more dangerous
