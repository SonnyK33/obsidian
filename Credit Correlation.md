The conventional wisdom is that in crises, correlations go to 1. Due to deleveraging and positioning, investors may be forced to indiscrimiantely sell everything, especially positions that have done well. This is plain to see if you naiively look at pricing action in 2008 or 2020. However, during the last two major crises, there was also massive factor rotation. This led to single name disperion. This phenomenon has only been exacerbated by retail option trading. The spike in single name options has increased single name implied volatilities, which holding index volatility constant, implies lower correlation/higher dispersion. In credit tranches, higher dispersion would mean wider equity tranches.
