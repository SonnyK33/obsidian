**General Trading**

Are you trading based on an edge or are you trading the variance risk premium ?
Edge implies you have a view based on the distribution of outcomes.
VRP means you're just trying to earn carry.

In a liquid market it's hard to lose more than the bid/ask consistently. This means there's good learning from trading small sizes frequently and documenting why you're doing the trade, why it worked or didn't, etc.  
  
Don’t focus on individual trading strategies but rather your edge in a certain trade - why are you doing the trade. There's no such thing as option trading strategies. There are option structures - which represent your view on the distribution of outcomes and what you're paying for. I think this is a good framework for all investing, including credit. See [[Credit Skew]]
Your edge should be captured in the price you’re paying for the options. That is, the options should be cheap relative to the distribution of outcomes you see.

You should exit a trade when your edge is gone not when you’re wrong - ie you shouldn't need  stops- if you’re forced to exit when you’re wrong the sizing is too big. When you've been proved to be wrong, maybe that reveals your lack of edge - you need to make this assessment.  

On the short vol side, you should be looking  where the VRP is highest on the vol surface .

Option trades not just till they expire - should continuously monitor for decaying edge and roll over if necessary


**Greeks**
[[Theta - WIP]]
The Greeks are just PnL attribution they don't explain why you made money, but how you made money.

At end of trade pnl is Vega x difference in IV and realized vol so units of vega a good way to track a trade 

Taylor expansion of an option price can help show where the risks are. See [[Theta - WIP]]




**Volatility Forecasting**
  
Garch has been picked over; there's likely more edge in factor analysis e.g. selling vol for a certain factor. 
  

**Trades**
- The credit version of factor based VRP selling is to just earn carry in certain factors - maybe in low vol consumer staples 


[[Gamma]]
- If delta hedged, long gamma means you will gain whether the underlying increases or decreases, everything else equal
- theta represents the cost of this optionality
