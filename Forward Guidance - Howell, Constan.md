Liquidity bottomed in Oct 22. Since then it’s risen from the PBOC, a weaker dollar, and lower bond volatility which makes it easier to repo. The lack of TGA issuance and the RRP have offset QT. The Fed is more concerned with the functioning of the treasury market than rates. They need to cut rate vol and may eventually move to YCC like Japan. There are $3tr of bank reserves and the Fed says the min is 1.5. Some academics say it should be 2.5 or there could be issues with refinancing. The TGA will be more volatile because of debt ceiling issues and tax season. There's a chance that the TGA goes below a minimum threshold which is why bank reserves are being kept constant. 

A lot of PBOC liquidity is coming in, more than twice previous years. This will boost commodities. He likes crypto because it tracks the easing of liquidity. Liquidity tracks an average of gold and crypto. Liquidity drives financial markets which drives the real economy. He likens this year to post-tech bubble, to 2002, except that Chinese liquidity is completely different now vs then. In 2002, we had impact of 911 and no China easing. The big drivers now are lower bond volatility, higher commodity prices, and Chinese liquidity. 

Fed wants to reduce its balance sheet but keep reserves flat. That requires winding down the RRP. 
They can adjust rates on that to make it less attractive. The Fed is paying more on RRP than earning on treasuries and MBS. That loss is liquidity for the system. The treasury has said TGA could go sub-100 but would like it to be 700. It’s 500 now so there’s a lot of volatility in the short term. The $2tr RRP is a bigger factor.  

Yield curve inversion does predict recessions but different pairs work better for different recessions. Have to take into account convexity. Right now the negative term premia matters because the curve is more inverted because of negative term premia in the 10yr. That’s caused by a shortage of collateral. Inversion tells you more about financial than economic fragility.  

Doesn’t think they’ll cut this year. The Fed is maintaining financial stability with the balance sheet and fighting inflation with rates. The Fed will cut eventually as inflation comes down but term premia will be rising due to less foreign demand. Japan is more focused on buying its own bonds. 
China and Saudi are buying fewer treasuries. And the rates market will range trade and hence so will equities.   

Historically strong flows into the US and EU were caused by a lack of good collateral. Basel III required banks to hold more and QE took most of it out of circulation especially in Europe. There's 
$60tr global debt due every year. Given higher rates and all the debt due for refi, debt to GDP will rise. This will require more liquidity. GDP will be growing at a slower pace, so liquidity to GDP is rising which means higher multiples. The fed will do YCC because they can’t pay higher rates.

So don’t buy treasuries, but buy stocks and commodities and crypto. He thinks a soft landing is the most likely. The business cycle still has to turn so could be short term noise. Likes China because of the liquidity.

Equities - likes commodities and EM (China) and cyclicals though that’s more dangerous
